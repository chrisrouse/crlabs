# Flow Grid — status and what's left

Branch `feature/flow-grid`. Everything below is deployed to the **Preview Org**
(`chris-b4pw@force.com`). The branch is committed but **not pushed** — around twenty
commits are local only.

Local checks: **516 Jest tests**, ESLint and Prettier clean, full-package deploy
succeeds. The SLDS linter reports **0 errors and 127 warnings**, all of them
pre-existing hardcoded colours and spacing — 55 in `fgrid_flowGridStudio.css`, 34 in
`fgrid_flowGrid.css`, and 70 auto-fixable with `--fix`. Nothing added since
2026-09-05 contributes to them. (An earlier note here claimed zero violations; the
linter had not actually been run.)

## 1. Browser testing — most of it is done

This section opened as "nothing has been tested in a browser". That is long out of
date: every feature has now been exercised at least once in the org, and several were
fixed as a direct result. What remains is listed in §1.6, which is the honest short list
— the unticked boxes below it are a mix of genuinely open items and ones verified in
passing without being recorded.

Test in this order — later items depend on earlier ones working.

### 1.1 Design time — the property editor

Open the smoke flow — now tracked at `force-app/main/default/flows/FlowGrid_Smoke_Test.flow-meta.xml`, see §2.14 — and click the Flow Grid element:
`/builder_platform_interaction/flowBuilder.app?flowDefId=300Ws00001Ef2jeIAB`

- [ ] The custom editor loads (ten accordion sections, not a flat list of inputs)
- [x] **Kit picker popovers position correctly** — anchored, and they now stay
      attached while a pane or the panel scrolls. Fixed and verified 2026-09-06;
      see §1.6 and upstream PR RebbePod/flow-config-editor-kit#25.
- [x] **Checkbox persistence.** Verified 2026-08-25, after four attempts — see §4.
      A Boolean that must default ON has to be stored AND labelled negatively;
      Flow Builder silently drops a `false` input parameter.
- [ ] Row Action → **Run a flow** → the flow picker appears directly beneath it,
      and the rest of the section stays hidden until a flow is chosen
- [ ] The flow list has no `Screen —` / `Autolaunched —` prefixes, no template
      flows, and reasonable left padding (see §3.1)
- [ ] Pick a flow, then type the variable names. Blank means "do not send".
- [ ] Type a name the flow does not declare, run the action, and confirm the grid
      reports the dropped name rather than failing the interview or going quiet

### 1.2 Design time — Grid Studio

- [x] **Open Grid Studio** renders the two-pane modal — verified 2026-09-05
- [ ] Preview banner is green and says "Live preview using real records"
- [ ] Column attributes table edits round-trip
- [x] **No canvas bleed-through** and no double-shade — fixed by moving to the
      platform modal, §3.2. Verified 2026-09-05 including with a component selected
      on the canvas, which was the original trigger.
- [x] **Collapsible settings pane** — chevron hides the left pane so the preview
      takes the full width. Verified 2026-09-05.
- [x] **Preview Size** at Large, Medium and Small narrows the simulated grid.
      Verified 2026-09-05.
- [x] **Filter dialog opens inside the Studio** with a single dim rather than three
      compounding. Verified 2026-09-05.
- [x] **Panes scroll independently**, so opening several settings sections does not
      drag the preview off screen. Verified 2026-09-05.
- [x] **Preview table renders at full width on open**, with no narrow-then-snap.
      Verified 2026-09-05.

### 1.3 Runtime — Debug the smoke flow

- [ ] Grid renders 314 Accounts with real labels, currency formatting on
      Annual Revenue, and the Name field as a record link
- [ ] Search, column filters (Name and Industry), Clear Filters
- [x] **Pagination verified 2026-08-27**, including changing rows per page in both
      directions and switching pages. Selection survives all of it, and scroll mode
      too.
- [x] **Sorting verified 2026-08-27**, including the linked Name column: it orders by
      name rather than by the generated URL, inverts on a second click, and reports
      `Name` to the flow rather than `Name__fgridUrl`. Inverting needed the columnKey
      fix in §1.4a — before it, a grid could only sort ascending.
- [x] **Show Blanks First** verified the same day. A header-menu action on any sortable
      column; blanks group at one end rather than sorting, so reversing does not
      scatter them.
- [x] **Selection verified 2026-08-27**, and it survives paging, changing rows per
      page in either direction, and scrolling. Two bugs were fixed to get there, and
      the second only appeared once the first was gone:

      1. `handleRowSelection` replaced the whole selection with what the datatable
         reported, and the datatable only knows the rows it renders — so paging away
         discarded everything picked elsewhere. Only the visible rows are reconciled
         now.
      2. The count was then right while the CHECKBOX was not. `selected-rows` returned
         the full key set, whose array identity does not change when the page does, so
         the datatable — having rebuilt its selection for the new data — was never
         handed the prop again. It is now filtered to the visible rows and memoized on
         `rows`, so the identity changes with the page.

      **Maximum selection across pages — confirmed broken, then fixed 2026-08-27.** It
      did allow three more on page two. The cap is now enforced in
      `handleRowSelection` rather than delegated to the datatable, which is handed
      only the keys for rows it can see and therefore counts one page at a time.

      Already-selected rows keep their place and only newly ticked ones are refused,
      so hitting the limit does not reshuffle what the user already had.

      **Then closed the door properly.** Refusing a click after the fact meant the
      checkbox ticked and un-ticked, and on the current page the datatable greyed the
      remaining boxes while leaving them live on every other page — the same ceiling
      behaving two different ways. At the maximum, every unselected row now goes into
      `disabled-rows`, which is the platform's own mechanism for "cannot change this
      row's selection" and works on any page. Deselecting frees a slot and they
      re-enable, because `disabledRows` is derived rather than stored.

      The message is derived too, so it appears the moment the maximum is reached
      rather than only when a click is refused: the rows stop responding at that point,
      and the reason may be a selection on a page the user cannot see.

### 1.4 Runtime — the Flow row action (the headline feature)

- [x] Click the row action: the modal opens and `FlowGrid_Edit_Account` renders.
      **Verified 2026-08-25.** This was the load-bearing assumption of the whole
      native row action — `lightning-flow` does work nested inside a running Flow
      screen.
- [x] Change the name, Finish: the modal closes and the grid shows the new value.
      **Verified 2026-08-25**, after fixing `event.detail.status` (the handler was
      reading `flowStatus`, so it never closed and the interview restarted,
      discarding the edits).
- [ ] `outputEditedRecords` / `editedCount` reflect it — not yet checked in the
      debug panel
- [ ] Cancel the modal instead: confirm nothing changes and no edit is recorded
- [ ] Finish without changing anything: confirm it does **not** appear in
      `outputEditedRecords` (the value-comparison path)
- [x] **Point the row action at an autolaunched flow.** Verified 2026-08-27 against
      the new `FlowGrid_Set_Rating` sample: no modal, and the table updated. Both row
      action launch modes are now confirmed working. This also exposed §2.3b — the
      change was reported as a pending edit even when the flow had saved it itself.
- [ ] **Deleted record:** have the launched flow delete the record, then confirm
      the row leaves the grid and lands in `outputRemovedRecords`

### 1.4a Runtime — inline editing

- [x] **Single-select picklist edits and commits.** Verified 2026-08-25.
- [x] **Multi-select picklist edits and commits**, array joined back to the stored
      `A;B` form. Verified 2026-08-25. Together these confirm `data-inputable="true"`
      is the commit path for a custom edit cell — see §2.1.
- [x] **Standard-type columns edit and commit.** Date, Datetime and Time verified
      2026-08-27 against a debug payload. Two defects found and fixed on the way; both
      are recorded below because both would be easy to reintroduce.

    **Drafts are keyed by `columnKey`, not `fieldName`.** This is the important one.
    Columns carry `columnKey: fieldName__index` so a dragged width survives a rebuild
    (§2.9), and the datatable then reports every inline edit under that key. Editing
    `Date_Test__c` arrived as `Date_Test__c__3` and `upsertRecord` wrote it verbatim,
    creating a phantom field. The failure is deceptive: the record genuinely differed,
    so a change was detected and Save was enabled, but the real field never received
    the value and the cell fell back to empty. Detected and discarded.

    `normalizeDraft` resolves each draft key through a columnKey-to-fieldName map. Do
    NOT remove that map when touching resize logic — the two features are coupled only
    through `columnKey`, and nothing else connects them.

    **The same trap caught SORTING on 2026-08-27.** Once a column carries a `columnKey`,
    the datatable identifies it by that everywhere, and `sorted-by` has to be echoed back
    as the columnKey. Feeding it the fieldName meant the table never recognised the
    column as sorted, so it refused to flip — the second click emitted NO event at all
    and a grid could only ever sort ascending. Found by console probe after three wrong
    guesses from static reading; the event detail carries both `fieldName` and
    `columnKey`, which is what gave it away.

    **The rule: any per-column state the datatable round-trips belongs to `columnKey`,
    not `fieldName`, once `columnKey` exists.** That is drafts, sort, and column widths
    so far. Check `handleHeaderAction` if a fourth turns up — it still matches on
    fieldName, which happens to work today.

    **`cellchange` reports only the cell that just changed**, not the accumulated draft
    set. Assigning `event.detail.draftValues` wholesale discarded every earlier edit as
    soon as a second cell was touched, and because `draft-values` is bound back to the
    table the first cell visibly reverted too. Drafts merge per row.

- [x] **`outputEditedRecords` drives a real database write.** Verified 2026-08-27,
      end to end: edited Date Test to Oct 6 2026, Save, then an Update Records element
      fed by `outputEditedRecords` ("Use the IDs and all field values from a record
      collection"). SOQL confirms `Date_Test__c = 2026-10-06` stored. The full records
      the output carries — CreatedDate, SystemModstamp, BillingAddress and the rest —
      did NOT cause a non-updateable-field error, so no sparse-record change is needed.

    **The Flow debug panel lies about Date fields.** It rendered the stored
    `2026-10-06` as "October 5, 2026 at 8:00 PM", parsing a date-only value as midnight
    UTC and formatting it in a UTC-4 user zone. Exactly the shift the
    lightning-formatted-date-time doc warns of, but in Flow's own debug UI — the value
    never had a time to shift. Trust the JSON payload or SOQL, not the formatted debug
    display, and do not "fix" a shift that only appears there.

- [x] **A cell edited back to its original value does not register.** Fixed and
      verified 2026-08-27. The comparison ran against `allKnownRecords`, which already
      has pending edits applied, so it asked "is this different from what I last typed"
      rather than "different from what we started with" — putting the original value
      back counted as another change and the record stayed flagged for good. Now
      measured against a baseline of the source record plus the saved overlay, and a
      record with nothing left differing drops out of `_editsByKey` entirely.

      Surfaced by auto-save, where every cell exit commits, but the Save path had it
      too.

- [x] **`editedCount` reflects inline edits.** Verified 2026-08-27 alongside the
      revert fix, which turns on that count being right.
- [x] **Cancel discards without touching the working collection.** Verified
      2026-08-27, including the layered case that actually proves it:
      null -> edit -> Save -> edit again -> Cancel restores the **saved** value, not
      the original null. Cancel reverts to whatever `_editsByKey` last committed
      rather than to the source record, which is the distinction that would have
      silently thrown away a committed edit had it been wrong.
- [x] **`navigateNextOnSave` advances the screen on Save.** Verified 2026-08-27.
- [x] **`autoSaveEdits` commits without buttons and does NOT advance.** Verified the
      same day. The two are mutually exclusive by design — auto-save leaves nothing
      pending, so there is no Save event for Navigate Next to react to, and the editor
      greys it out while auto-save is on.
- [x] **Inverted by decision 2026-08-27, not tested.** A stored value that is no longer
      active is NOT offered — matching a record page, where changing away from it is
      one-way unless the user cancels. See the picklist section.
- [x] **`suppressBottomBar` REMOVED 2026-08-27** rather than tested. Two reasons, and
      the second is decisive. It was probably broken: `onsave` is the only path that
      calls `upsertRecord`, so hiding the Save button would have left every edit as a
      draft that never reached `outputEditedRecords`, and the help text promised the
      opposite ("edits apply as soon as the user leaves the cell"). And the reference
      forbids it outright — "The table-level errors require the table bottom bar to be
      present. Don't include the attribute `suppress-bottom-bar`" — so the setting
      silently disabled the error reporting `tableErrors` exists to provide.
      `navigateNextOnSave` also fired from the same handler, so hiding the bar broke
      that too: one checkbox quietly disabling three things.

      **Replaced by `autoSaveEdits` the same day**, which keeps the useful half. Each
      edit commits as the user leaves the cell, so nothing is ever pending and the
      Cancel and Save buttons never appear — not hidden, simply unnecessary. The bar
      itself remains, so table-level errors keep somewhere to go. Labelled "Hide the
      Cancel/Save Buttons" because that is what an admin sees happen; the help text
      carries the part the label cannot, that there is no undo.

      `navigateNextOnSave` is greyed while it is on, for the same reason as before:
      no Save event to react to. Auto-save takes its own path through
      `handleCellChange`, so it needs the same columnKey translation the Save path
      does — covered by a test, because that bug was expensive the first time.

- [ ] Recalculate the incoming collection mid-edit and confirm unsaved edits are
      discarded — the §2.6 rule

### 1.4b Runtime — disabled rows

- [x] **Disabled records greys the matching rows and blocks selection.** Verified
      2026-08-26 with a Collection Filter output (`Status`-style filter on Industry =
      Energy) wired to Disabled records: rows 6, 9 and 10 rendered with greyed radio
      buttons while row 5 stayed selectable.
      This verifies the kit patch end to end as well — the Collection Filter output is
      not merely visible in the picker, it is consumed as a real input at runtime.
- [x] **Answered by the reference, 2026-08-27: it does NOT.** "Use the `disabled-rows`
      attribute to prevent users from changing the **selection status** of specified
      rows." Selection only — a disabled row can still be inline-edited and its row
      action still fires. An earlier note here guessed otherwise from the phrase
      "cannot modify"; that was wrong. See the decision below.

#### Disabled rows stay editable and actionable — DECIDED 2026-08-27

Two options were proposed and both declined: "Prevent editing disabled records" and
"Prevent row actions on disabled records".

The row-action half was clean — `button` and `button-icon` both accept `disabled` as a
typeAttribute, which resolves per row via `{ fieldName }`, so the control would render
greyed and genuinely refuse the click.

The editing half was not. `editable` is per COLUMN with no per-row override, so the
pencil would still appear on a disabled row and the only enforcement point is the
commit: drop the draft and flag the row through `errors`. That is "you may start the
edit and it will be refused", not "you cannot start it". Declined on that basis rather
than shipping half a guarantee, and the row-action option went with it rather than
leaving a partial story.

Reinstating either means accepting that ceiling; the platform is unlikely to move.

### 1.5 Runtime — Remove row action

- [x] **Remove verified end to end, 2026-08-27.** `rowActionType` set to Remove, the
      row taken out of the grid, and `outputRemovedRecords` fed to a Delete Records
      element — the record was deleted. Several rows removed and deleted in one pass
      works too. That is the second output collection proven to drive real DML, after
      `outputEditedRecords` and Update Records.
      **A failed delete leaves the grid out of step.** The Remove action takes the row out
      of the collection immediately; the DML happens later, in the calling flow. If the
      delete fails — a closed-won opportunity blocking an Account cascade, a delete-time
      validation rule, a trigger — the row is gone from the grid while the record still
      exists. Observed 2026-08-27 with DELETE_FAILED.

    Nothing to fix in the component: there is no API that answers "can I delete this",
    and reimplementing Salesforce's cascade rules would be wrong and permanently stale.
    Worth knowing the alternatives, in increasing effort:

    1. A fault path on Delete Records, showing `{!$Flow.FaultMessage}`. Minimum viable.
    2. Loop and delete one at a time, each with a fault path — Flow DML is all-or-nothing
       per element, so one bad record currently blocks the whole batch ("We couldn't
       delete any records").
    3. **Use a Flow row action rather than Remove.** Point it at an autolaunched flow that
       deletes with a fault path. The grid re-reads the row afterwards: gone means the row
       leaves, still there means it stays. Per-row outcome, and no window where the grid
       and the database disagree — removal FOLLOWS the re-read instead of preceding it.

- [x] **The removal cap is verified, 2026-08-27**, including across pages. Exceeding
      Maximum Rows Removable refuses the extra removal and shows "You can only remove N
      rows at once."

      It counts across pages for a reason worth contrasting with selection: removals
      live in `_removedKeys`, our own state, and were never delegated to the datatable.
      The selection cap WAS delegated, and the datatable only sees the rows it renders
      — which is exactly why it counted one page at a time until it was moved into
      `handleRowSelection`. Same feature, two paths, and only the delegated one broke.

- [x] **`outputRemainingRecords` verified, 2026-08-27** — it updates as rows are marked
      for removal, not only at Save, so a downstream element always sees the complement
      of what was removed.

---

### 1.6 What is actually left to test

Everything else in §1 has either been verified or closed by decision. These have not:

**Design time**

- [x] **Kit picker popovers stay attached to their field — FIXED 2026-09-06.** Both
      halves, verified in the browser: the Studio's panes and the narrow property
      panel.

      What the phrase meant, since it said nothing on its own. The kit's resource,
      object and field pickers do not render their dropdown inline. They render it
      `position: fixed` at coordinates they compute themselves, and reposition from a
      capture-phase `scroll` listener bound to `window`. `scroll` is not composed, so
      it cannot cross a shadow boundary — neither our own scrolling panes nor Flow
      Builder's property panel, whose scroller sits inside Flow Builder's shadow root,
      can be observed that way. Confirmed by console: a capture-phase `scroll`
      listener on `document` logs nothing at all while that panel scrolls. So the
      handler never ran and the popover stayed where it was drawn.

      **`position: fixed` is not the kit's mistake.** Measured across four contexts in
      Flow Builder, `lightning-base-combobox` uses `absolute; top: 100%` in the
      toolbar, the canvas and Component Visibility, but switches to `fixed` with
      computed pixels inside a `lightning-accordion-section` — which is exactly where
      our controls live. The kit makes the same choice Salesforce does. Only the
      update trigger was wrong.

      **Native does track its field**, including following it out of view rather than
      clamping, so this brings our pickers in line with the platform rather than ahead
      of it.

      **The fix**: a per-frame anchor check in `fgrid_flowGridEditor` and
      `fgrid_flowGridStudio`. One probe rect per animation frame; when it moves,
      re-dispatch a `scroll` on `window` and let the kit recompute from its own
      anchor. It covers a scroll wherever it happens, plus transforms, animations and
      layout shifts, and never reaches outside the component — so the question of
      whether traversing into Flow Builder's DOM is permitted under Lightning Web
      Security never arises. A single probe is enough because everything in a scroller
      moves together and the kit only needs telling THAT something moved.

      Rejected on the way: an ancestor-scroll walk (needs cross-shadow traversal,
      catches only the scrollers found at open time, blind to transforms) and inline
      rendering (a 440px browsing UI clips to about two rows in a 12rem container, and
      native is not inline here either).

      **This belongs upstream, and is a workaround until it lands. PR submitted
      2026-09-06: RebbePod/flow-config-editor-kit#25.** Every consumer of the kit needs
      this otherwise. The upstream version reuses the controller's existing
      `run`/`schedule` machinery rather than adding a loop, re-entrancy guarded so a
      synchronous `requestAnimationFrame` shim cannot recurse unboundedly — their
      shared `pickerTestUtils` invokes rAF synchronously, which caught that. It also
      updates `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and two of their tests, since an open picker now
      occupies animation frames and a shared frame queue no longer identifies which
      controller scheduled one. Verified with their own gates: `npm run verify` (19
      suites, 194 tests, coverage thresholds) and `sf project deploy validate` against
      the Preview Org, 21 components and 9 Apex tests, deploy `0AfWs00001c04GXKAY`.

      **WHEN IT MERGES**: re-pin `vendor/flow-config-editor-kit` in `VENDOR.md`, refresh
      the skill's docs with `check-upstream.sh --update`, and then DELETE the
      consumer-side watcher from `fgrid_flowGridEditor` and `fgrid_flowGridStudio`
      along with its tests. Keeping both would mean two mechanisms doing the same job.

      A standalone reproduction is at `repro/picker-popover-scroll/` — offered in the PR
      as available on request rather than linked, since this repo is private.

      Two smaller divergences from native are noted there too, worth raising alongside:
      the kit's `z-index: 1000000` against native's 7000/9101 — the likely reason the
      popover paints over Flow Builder canvas chrome that native dropdowns sit within —
      and its 440px height against native's seven-item cap.

- [ ] **Flow variable mapping.** Blank means "do not send"; a name the flow does not
      declare should be reported rather than failing the interview or going quiet.
- [ ] **Preview banner** reads "Live preview using real records" and is green.

**Runtime — the row action**

- [ ] **Cancel the modal**: nothing changes and no edit is recorded.
- [ ] **Finish without changing anything**: the record does NOT appear in
      `outputEditedRecords`. This is the value-comparison path, shared with inline
      editing where it is now verified.
- [x] **A launched flow that DELETES its record — VERIFIED 2026-09-06.** The row
      leaves the grid, the count drops, and the id lands in `outputRemovedRecords`.
      The reconcile path works.

      Reporting it did not. It came through `_flowError`, the same channel as four
      real failures, so a successful deletion rendered as a warning with
      `role="alert"` and titled the row "This row's action did not finish". And the
      grid could not tell it from a row that was ALREADY stale when clicked, because
      it only re-read afterwards — opposite outcomes reported identically.

      Both fixed: the record is checked BEFORE launching, so a missing one is an
      error and the flow does not run; outcomes are toasts, success or error, silent
      on cancel. See the toast notes below.

**Runtime — data**

- [ ] **Recalculate the incoming collection mid-edit** and confirm unsaved edits are
      discarded — the §2.6 rule. Now narrowed to the columns in use, so a change to an
      unshown field should NOT discard them.
- [ ] **Percent fields**, display and edit. §2.5 gap 6.

**Row numbers cannot be turned off on an editable grid — settled 2026-09-10**

From the `lightning-datatable` documentation, under Handle Errors:

> To show errors for a column, you must make the column editable. When there's an
> editable column, `lightning-datatable` sets the `show-row-number-column`
> attribute to true to show the row errors in the number column. **You can't
> override this setting.**

The row error icon lives in the row number column, so any editable column takes
that column whether asked or not. Flow Grid's runtime grid has editable columns,
so **Show Row Numbers has no effect there** — the column is always on. Grid Studio
is unaffected because its preview builds columns with `forceReadOnly: true`.

`showRowNumbers` is still passed through, because it does decide the column on a
read-only grid.

**Confirmed by experiment, not only by the documentation:** with editing removed
from every column, Show Row Numbers off does hide the column. Turn editing back on
for any column and it returns. So the doc sentence is exactly right and there is
nothing further to look for.

| Replaced it with a row number column of our own      | Rendered fine and un-clipped, but the forced column appeared alongside it, so there were two |

The custom column is reverted. It worked, but it cannot solve the problem while
the platform's column is also forced on, and two number columns is worse than one.

**The clipping is a separate, still-open platform defect.** The forced column is
sized one digit short of its largest number, so a ten-row grid clips at 10. See
repro/datatable-row-number-clip. Nothing in our code affects it.

**The lesson, since it cost the most time in this project so far:** the answer was
one sentence in the component's own documentation, in a section about errors rather
than about row numbers. Six deploys of instrumentation and five wrong theories
preceded reading it. When a platform attribute does not behave as set, search the
whole component doc for the attribute NAME before theorising about causes.

**Row-action outcome wording — decided 2026-09-07**

- Three properties carry every message a site visitor reads:
  `rowActionFlowSuccessMessage`, `rowActionFlowErrorMessage`,
  `rowActionFlowDeleteMessage`. Each is the WHOLE toast, in `label` with `message`
  left unset — required, not stylistic, because small screens and the mobile app
  drop `message` and keep only `label`. Blank suppresses.
- The error message is ALSO the row error's title, replacing our own "This row's
  action did not finish". Every reason the grid authors itself now reports as that
  one string; only the flow's own fault text, wrapped by
  [FlowGridController.cls:155](force-app/main/default/classes/FlowGridController.cls),
  still gets a detail line, because it is the one message we cannot write better.
  So a blank error message silences the row error too.
- Lost deliberately: "Refresh to update the grid" for a stale row. It was the one
  actionable sentence in the set; an admin who wants it puts it in their message.
- `mode` is left unset on `Toast.show`. The platform derives it from the variant:
  `success` with no links auto-dismisses after 4.8s, `error` stays until closed,
  which is the behaviour we want in both cases. There is no `pester` mode and no
  fixed default — both were things I claimed and neither is true.
- **Defaults must be listed in `DEFAULTS` in fgrid_propertySchema as well as in the
  `@api` initialisers and js-meta.xml.** The `@api` default only affects the runtime;
  that map is what seeds the editor's fields. Omitting them showed three empty boxes
  whose help text says a blank hides the message — the panel implying "no toast"
  while the component would have shown one. A test guards it, and the rule
  generalises: any property where BLANK is a meaningful setting has to be seeded.

**Preventing dismissal mid-flow — added 2026-09-07**

- `rowActionFlowPreventClose`, off by default, screen-flow actions only. For a flow
  that gathers input across several screens, where dismissing half way through
  discards everything typed.
- **Two mechanisms, because one is not enough.** `disableClose` — the base class's
  property, passed through `open()` — blocks Escape and `close()` and sets
  `disabled` on the close button. It does NOT hide it: measured in the site,
  `display: flex` and `opacity: 1`, so the X was drawn at full strength and did
  nothing when clicked. Users found that more confusing than either extreme.
  `renderedCallback` therefore also sets `display: none` on it.
- **Hiding it needs platform DOM we do not own, and there is no alternative.** The
  button is in `lightning-modal-base`'s NATIVE shadow root:
  `document.querySelectorAll(".slds-modal__close").length` is 0 with a modal open,
  so neither our CSS nor the site's can select it, and no styling hook covers
  visibility. Custom properties DO cross that boundary — which is how site branding
  recolours the X, and why it looked enabled rather than dimmed — but cannot express
  `display`. The path used is one hop and not a search: this component is slotted
  into the container, so `host.getRootNode()` is its shadow root and the button is a
  sibling of the slot.
- Both are kept rather than replacing one with the other: if LWS blocks the
  traversal or the platform renames `data-close-button`, the button returns
  **disabled**, so a stray click still cannot discard a half-finished flow.
- `disableClose` blocks `close()` too, so every close routes through
  `closeWithOutcome`, which releases the lock first. Setting the lock and calling
  `close()` directly would trap the user with no way out at all, including the flow
  succeeding. A test asserts `open()` still resolves while locked; remove the
  release and it never settles.
- The trade, stated in the help text: with the lock on, only the flow finishing or
  faulting closes the modal. A flow with a screen that has no path onward leaves the
  user stuck until they reload. Use it only where every branch reaches an end.
- **"No declarative route" was mistaken for "no route" here**, and written into the
  code as settled fact before being tested. CSS was correctly ruled out; the
  imperative path was never tried until the third time it was asked for.
- [x] Verified in the LWR site, locked and unlocked.

**Row-action toasts — decided 2026-09-06**

- Uses `lightning/toast`, NOT `lightning/platformShowToastEvent`. The platform event
  only surfaces where something listens for it: measured in an org, it worked in an
  Aura site and produced **nothing at all** in LWR — the worse half, since a site
  user got neither the confirmation nor the error. `Toast.show` brings its own
  page-level container, so it renders in LWR too. Its title property is `label`.
- The container is lifted to `z-index: 100002` via `ToastContainer.instance()`, the
  sanctioned handle. An LWR theme's sticky header measured 100001. Bisected from
  both sides: with the container at 10000, a header at 10000 lost and 10001 won. A
  high value is defensible for a toast in a way it is not for a popover; SLDS puts
  toasts above its own modals. **Tuned to an observed theme: if another site's
  chrome goes higher, move to `bottom-center` rather than raising it again.**
- **Re-asserted for a 1s window after every toast, at 50ms intervals — 2026-09-07.**
  The write always landed; the platform kept undoing it.

    The modal row action's toast appeared above the site header and then **sank behind
    it**, while the two autolaunched actions were fine. That "briefly correct, then
    sinks" detail is what cracked it — it meant our value was being applied and then
    overwritten, not failing to apply.

    Traced with a `MutationObserver` on `lightning-overlay-container`'s shadow root,
    following each mutation's `oldValue` for `lightning-toast-container`. The element
    id was stable throughout, so it is **rewritten, never replaced**:

    | ms   | `oldValue` | what happened                                                                  |
    | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | 2459 | `10000`    | modal opens; we set 100002                                                     |
    | 2459 | `100002`   | platform rewrites to 10000                                                     |
    | 4500 | `10000`    | our `toast()` elevation sets 100002                                            |
    | 4679 | `100002`   | platform rewrites to 10000, same batch as `lightning-modal-base` being REMOVED |

    Nothing rewrites it after teardown, so a late write sticks. Note `open()`'s promise
    resolved at ~4500 while the modal was not removed until ~4679 — awaiting the modal
    is not enough.

    **A window, not a delay.** The measured gap was ~180ms, but tuning one
    `setTimeout` to it would repeat the mistake behind four failed fixes: fitting a
    number to a single observation. Correctness here needs only that the platform
    stops eventually. The `!==` guard makes redundant passes free, and on the
    autolaunched paths every pass is redundant. Cleared in `disconnectedCallback`.

    **Four earlier attempts, all measured and all reverted:**

    1. Elevate before `Toast.show` only — the platform overwrote it 180ms later.
    2. Elevate again on the next animation frame — one frame is ~16ms, far too early.
    3. Elevate a host found via `document.querySelector` — returns nothing, because the
       container is inside a **native** shadow root. Reachable via
       `overlay.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll(...)` from the console, and via
       `ToastContainer.instance()` from code, but never from a document query.
    4. Elevate before `open()` so the container pre-dates the overlay — still rewritten.

    **Also rejected:**

    - _`toastPosition: "bottom-center"`_ — worked, reverted. It dodged the header, but
      a confirmation at the bottom of a long site page is easy to miss.
    - _A `loadStyle` static resource injecting `lightning-toast-container { z-index:
1000001 !important }`_ — rejected on packaging grounds, and probably would not
      have worked anyway: a document stylesheet cannot cross into a native shadow
      root. The hand test that appeared to prove it was almost certainly DevTools
      injecting into the right shadow context for the selected element. **Do not
      recommend site CSS for this**; it was recorded as the fallback for several hours
      and was likely never viable.
    - _Raising the number._ It was never too low.

- **Five wrong diagnoses preceded the answer, from three repeated mistakes.**

    _Reasoning about the failing case without a control._ Broken by noticing the
    autolaunched actions worked and only the modal path did not. **Compare a working
    path against a broken one before theorising.**

    _Treating the jest stubs as platform documentation._ A round went to concluding
    `instance()` returns a style-less component instance, because `sfdx-lwc-jest`'s
    hand-written stub exposes only `containerPosition`, `maxToasts`, `toastPosition`
    and `close()`. The real one returns the live element with a usable `style`.

    _Reading a negative result as proof of impossibility._ `querySelectorAll` returning
    0 was taken as "unreachable from JS", which killed the whole approach for several
    rounds. It only ever meant "not reachable _that way_" — `instance()` had been
    reaching it the entire time, as the 100002 rows above show.

    And underneath all three: the original unit test asserted `container.style.zIndex`
    against a `{ style: {} }` mock invented to match the code, so it stayed green
    throughout. **A mock invented to match the code under test proves nothing about the
    platform.** Both current tests were checked against the mutation they guard — one
    fails when the retry call is removed, the other when the window is made unbounded.

- Verified: an Aura site shows a SINGLE toast, which mattered because `Toast.show`
  also dispatches a ShowToastEvent that an Aura site listens for, so it could have
  rendered twice.
- [x] **Confirmed in the LWR site, 2026-09-07.** The modal row action's toast now
      stays above the site header instead of sinking behind it. All three row-action
      paths clear the header.
- Verified: an Aura site shows a SINGLE toast, which mattered because `Toast.show`
  also dispatches a ShowToastEvent that an Aura site listens for, so it could have
  rendered twice.
- [ ] **Re-verify in the LWR site** — 1000001 on the host was confirmed by hand in
      DevTools, but not yet as deployed code.
- [ ] **Lightning Experience / Flow Builder debug** — untested for that same
      duplicate. Shares the mechanism with Aura, so likely fine, but unconfirmed.

## 2. Not built yet

### 2.1 Inline editing — Stage A built, Stage B outstanding

Split once the docs made clear that `lightning-datatable` already provides inline
editing _and_ the Cancel/Save bar for every standard type. The subclass is only
needed for picklists, so it is no longer a prerequisite for the feature.

**Stage A — done 2026-08-25, not yet browser-tested.** Standard types, on the
stock `lightning-datatable`:

- `draft-values` bound, with `oncellchange` / `onsave` / `oncancel`
- `onsave` routes each draft through `upsertRecord`, which already keeps only
  genuinely-differing fields and publishes `outputEditedRecords` / `editedCount`
- `navigateNextOnSave` dispatches `FlowNavigationNextEvent`
- **The Cancel/Save bar is always present.** It was once hardcoded off, then briefly
  bound to a `suppressBottomBar` property, which was removed on 2026-08-27: the bar
  carries table-level errors, and the reference says not to suppress it
- a column is editable only when its column config sets `edit`. There is no
  grid-level switch, and `defaultEditable` is deliberately not passed at runtime

No DML, consistent with the rest of the component: the calling flow commits
`outputEditedRecords` if it wants the change persisted.

**Stage B — built and verified in Flow debug 2026-08-25.** `fgrid_customDatatable`
extends `LightningDatatable` and registers two custom types:

- `fgridPicklist` — `lightning-combobox` edit template
- `fgridMultiPicklist` — scroll-capped `lightning-checkbox-group`. Chosen over a
  dual listbox: one list, multi-select, no ctrl-click to discover, and two stacked
  boxes plus move buttons do not fit an inline-edit panel

Both grids use the subclass now, the runtime one and the Studio preview — a column
config enabling edit on a picklist emits a custom cell type, which a plain
`lightning-datatable` cannot render.

Design points worth keeping:

- **A custom type is used only when the column is editable.** A read-only picklist
  is indistinguishable from text, so it stays `text` and avoids our render path.
- **Options are addressed per row**, via `typeAttributes: { options: { fieldName } }`,
  not passed per column. That is what allows a row holding a value no longer in the
  active list to keep it as a selectable, preselected option instead of losing it
  on save. Rows with in-range values all share one array instance, so only
  genuinely stale rows allocate.
- **`--None--` is baked into that per-row list** when `allowNoneToBeChosen` is on,
  rather than being a separate flag the template has to interpret. Never offered
  for multi-select, where clearing every box already says "no value".
- **Multi-select converts on the way out.** The checkbox group's value is an array;
  the field stores `A;B`. `normalizeDraft` joins it and also strips the synthetic
  `__fgridOptions` / `__fgridSelected` row fields, which are not record fields and
  would otherwise be published as edits.

**The undocumented bit, now confirmed.** Salesforce documents what an edit template
_receives_ (`editedValue`, `columnLabel`, `required`, `typeAttributes`) and that the
control needs `data-inputable="true"` for accessibility — but never documents how a
custom edit cell reports its value _back_, deferring vaguely to the standard
`draft-values`/`onsave` path.

`data-inputable="true"` **is** the mechanism: the inline-edit machinery reads the
committed value off the element carrying it. Verified in Flow debug 2026-08-25 —
both single-select (`lightning-combobox`) and multi-select
(`lightning-checkbox-group`) commit through it, including the array-to-`;`-string
conversion in `normalizeDraft`.

So the attribute is load-bearing, not decorative. Removing it from either edit
template breaks committing, and the failure would look like "the edit silently
does nothing" rather than an error.

Still unused: `recordTypeId` and `showAllPicklistValues`. Both are accepted
properties that nothing reads, so a picklist restricted by record type currently
offers values the user may not be allowed to pick — see §2.5.

**Stage C — editable lookups, built 2026-08-25, not yet browser-tested.** A third
custom type, `fgridLookup`, with `lightning-record-picker` as its editor: it
searches one object and yields a recordId, which is exactly what the field stores,
so the draft needs no conversion.

Display follows the standard datatable's two **Display Options**, per column, both
defaulting on:

- **Show record name** — display `Account.Name` instead of the raw Id. Read
  straight off the record, so it depends on the Flow having queried the
  relationship; falls back to the Id rather than an empty cell when it hasn't.
- **Link to record** — make the text a link. The platform's own pattern settles the
  click question: the text navigates, the datatable's edit pencil edits.

Both live in the per-row **Advanced** block of the Studio's column table, shown
only on lookup rows. They are stored inverted — `false` persists, `true` clears the
key — so the saved config carries only explicit opt-outs.

**Polymorphic lookups are refused.** `OwnerId`, `WhoId`, `WhatId` and friends return
several targets from `getReferenceTo()`, and a record picker searches one object.
Apex reports `isPolymorphic` and withholds `referenceTo`; `buildColumns` then forces
the column read-only _even if the column config asked for editing_, and the editor
explains why instead of appearing to ignore the setting.

**Discovery worth remembering:** Apex's `NON_EDITABLE_TYPES` only sets the DEFAULT.
`buildColumns` resolves editability as `attributes.edit ?? (isEditable && defaultEditable)`,
so an explicit `edit` in a column's config overrides it. That is how multi-select
picklists worked before Stage B existed — and it meant a lookup could already be
forced into a free-text box for an 18-character Id. MULTIPICKLIST and REFERENCE have
both been removed from that set now that real editors exist.

**Search, sort and filter follow the displayed name**, not the stored Id. Columns
can carry `fgridTextField` naming the row field that holds the text on screen;
`searchablePaths`, `handleSort` and `filterInputs` all prefer it. This generalises
what `fgridLinkFor` already did for a linked Name column, whose own fieldName holds
a generated URL.

One subtlety in `filterInputs`: the column config is keyed by the real field path
while matching runs against the display field, so it now tracks `configKey` and
`path` separately. Collapsing them back into one value would silently disable
filtering on every lookup column.

This did NOT need the broader label rework. A lookup's display text is already
materialised per row, so pointing at it was a three-line change. Picklists are
different — they display the stored value, so display and search already agree, and
nothing needs doing there.

### 2.2a `fgrid_flowGrid` test coverage — CLOSED 2026-08-27

This section used to say the runtime grid had no Jest tests at all, and that every
runtime behaviour rested on browser testing. That is no longer true: it now carries the
largest suite in the project, covering draft handling and the columnKey translation,
selection across pages and its cap, sorting and blanks-first, auto-save and reverting an
edit, the change signature, wrapped lines, the picklist fan-out, and validation.

The §2.6 signature path called out here as the riskiest uncovered code is covered, and
was narrowed to the columns in use while it was.

### 2.2 Apex test coverage — CLEARED 2026-08-27

| Class                    | Was | Now      |
| ------------------------ | --- | -------- |
| `FlowGridColumnService`  | 94% | 88%      |
| `FlowGridController`     | 23% | **95%**  |
| `FlowGridFlowService`    | 0%  | **93%**  |
| `FlowGridPreviewService` | 0%  | **89%**  |
| `FlowGridRecordService`  | 0%  | **100%** |

59 Apex tests, 100% pass. Every class is at or above the org's 80% floor, so this no
longer blocks packaging. Three new test classes:
`FlowGridFlowServiceTest`, `FlowGridPreviewServiceTest`, `FlowGridRecordServiceTest`.

**`FlowGridFlowService` was the awkward one, as predicted.** Its inputs are metadata,
not data — a test cannot insert a flow. Resolved by splitting the problem:
`resolveLaunchMode` carries the branching that actually matters (which flows Flow Grid
can launch), so it was made `@TestVisible` and is exercised directly and
deterministically across all four process/trigger combinations. The query methods are
called for real and asserted on their contract, then skipped when the org has no
suitable flow — the pattern `FlowGridColumnServiceTest` already used for FLS.

One trap worth recording: the first version of the variables test picked the first
active flow it found, which declared no variables, so the mapping loop never ran and
the test passed while covering nothing. It now searches for a flow that actually
declares variables. **A test that passes is not evidence that it tested anything.**

#### Unreachable code was removed rather than tolerated — 2026-08-27

The first pass left ten uncovered `catch` blocks in the controller and called them
"unreachable by design". Leaving unreachable code is not a design; it also contradicts
the standing rule against error handling for impossible scenarios. So each one was
probed with a throwaway test class to establish reachability with evidence, then either
deleted or covered.

**Probe results, all measured rather than reasoned:**

| Path                | Finding                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Action            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `getGridMetadata`   | `FlowGridColumnService` has no `throw` and no `catch`. A trailing dot, leading dot, doubled dot, four-level path, unknown relationship and dotted object name were all probed: every one returned normally. | catch DELETED     |
| `getPreviewRecords` | The service catches around its own query and returns empty. Nothing can escape.                                                                                                                             | catch DELETED     |
| `getFlows`          | Throws `System.QueryException` for a minimum-access user.                                                                                                                                                   | kept, now COVERED |
| `getFlowVariables`  | Same — `System.QueryException`.                                                                                                                                                                             | kept, now COVERED |
| `getRecordsByIds`   | Reachable by design since `fetchRecords` stopped swallowing.                                                                                                                                                | kept, uncovered   |
| `runFlow`           | Reachable — an unknown flow cannot start.                                                                                                                                                                   | already covered   |

Result: `FlowGridController` 80% -> **95%**, with only lines 180-181 uncovered, and
those are the one catch that has to exist — `fetchRecords` deliberately propagates so
the grid does not mistake a query failure for a deletion. Not deterministically
testable, and correct to keep.

**`FlowGridFlowService` 185, 189-191, 194** stay uncovered: `interview.start()` and the
output-reading loop need an active AUTOLAUNCHED flow to invoke, and the org's
row-action flow is a screen flow, which `Flow.Interview` cannot run. Shipping a
test-only flow to reach five lines is the wrong trade. **The headless row-action path
therefore has no automated coverage at all** — see §1.4, still unchecked in the browser.

**`FlowGridPreviewService` 62, 65** stay too: that swallow is the correct one. A
preview is a convenience, an empty result unambiguously means "fall back to fabricated
rows", and the consequence is cosmetic. It is also precisely why the controller's
wrapper around it was dead.

Org-wide coverage reads 19%, which is unrelated: this dev org holds the vendored kit
and other unofficialSF classes. Per-class is what packaging enforces.

### 2.3 Variable mapping is text, by choice

Variable names are typed rather than picked. Discovery-backed dropdowns were built
and then cut: they read well, but the scaffolding around the mechanism — refresh
button, version-mismatch warnings, stale-mapping flags — outgrew the task, which
is only ever "name two variables".

Discovery still runs at runtime to drop names the flow does not declare, because
the mapping properties carry platform defaults that cannot be removed. See §4.

If this ever wants to become the Screen Action-style list — enumerate the flow's
inputs, toggle each, Missing badges — that needs discovery back in the editor.
`FlowGridController.getFlowVariables` is still there and tested by hand.

### 2.3b A row action that saves its own changes — added 2026-08-27

**The problem, found in the browser.** A headless row action pointed at a flow that
performs its own DML still reported the change through `outputEditedRecords`, so the
calling flow would have saved it a second time. Whether a row-action change is pending
depends entirely on what the launched flow did, and only its author knows.

**The decision: an admin property that gates a verification, not a suppression.**
`rowActionFlowSavesChanges` ("The launched flow saves its own changes") is off by
default, so nothing changed for existing configurations. When it is on, the grid does
NOT simply discard the change — it compares each changed field against the record as
re-read from the database (a query `reconcileRow` already performs) and moves only the
fields that genuinely match. A flow that saves two fields and returns three reports
exactly the one that is still unsaved.

Boolean note: this one defaults OFF, so it needs no negative label or inversion — the
§4 trap only bites a Boolean that must default ON.

**Two overlays now, and the distinction matters.** `_editsByKey` is what the calling
flow should save; `_savedByKey` is what the user sees. A change confirmed present in
the database moves to the second, because the cell must still show it — the collection
the grid was handed is stale by then. `allKnownRecords` applies saved first and pending
second, so a later inline edit of the same field wins. Both are cleared when the source
collection is recalculated (the §2.6 rule).

**Test note worth keeping.** The first version of these tests left the
`getRecordsByIds` mock returning undefined, which the grid correctly read as "the
record was deleted". They passed while asserting nothing about the feature. What the
database returns IS the test here. Second time today that a green test proved nothing —
see also §2.2 on the flow-variables loop.

### 2.3a Actioned Record means CLICKED — decided 2026-08-27

`outputActionedRecord` is a SINGLE record ({T}), not a collection. The collection and
`markActionedRows` both went in `5b92d6a5`; if Flow Builder still offers a collection,
that is a stale component definition in the flow, not the current metadata.

It now publishes on **click**, before either row-action branch, and reports the row
the user acted on regardless of what the action then did: a cancelled flow, a flow
that changed nothing, and a removal refused by the cap all still report. Previously it
waited for an outcome, which made it a second, weaker "edited" — and left the
genuinely useful case (the user clicked, then backed out) reporting nothing at all.

The distinction that matters: **Edited Records is what changed. Actioned Record is
what the user clicked.** They answer different questions and neither substitutes for
the other.

**A collection was added alongside it, 2026-08-27.** `outputActionedRecordIds`
(`String[]`) accumulates the key of every actioned row, in click order, with repeats
collapsed — it records WHICH rows were actioned, not how many clicks. The single
`outputActionedRecord` was deliberately kept: it holds only the most recent click,
which is what makes it useful for reacting to on the same screen and useless for
reporting afterwards. Two questions, two outputs, neither replacing the other.

### 2.3c Row actions on a user-defined object — 2026-09-19

Row actions work in this mode. Two things behave differently, both correctly, and
both worth knowing before someone reports them as bugs.

**The record variable is shaped from the flow's own declaration.** A user-defined
row is not an SObject, and Record Input Variable is a free-text box, so an admin
here has no choice but to name a Text variable — which was then handed over as
`type: "SObject"` and mismatched. `recordInput` now reads `dataType` off the
flow's variable list and sends JSON to a Text variable, the record to an SObject
variable. This corrected the SObject mode too, where naming a Text variable was
silently broken the same way. Before the variable list arrives there is nothing
to ask, so it falls back to the source mode — the same "trust the configuration"
stance `acceptsInput` takes.

`readReturnedRecord` closes the return leg: a flow handing the row back through a
Text variable returns a JSON string, which previously matched no branch and was
silently dropped despite the help text promising otherwise. A malformed string
falls through to the field-level outputs rather than losing the result.

**Deliberately unchanged:**

- `outputActionedRecord` (typed) stays null — there is no SObject to publish.
  `Actioned Record (JSON)` carries it. Same for selected, edited, removed and
  remaining.
- `recordStillExists` and `reconcileRow` both return early, so there is no
  staleness detection and no post-action database refresh. Correct: there is no
  record to re-read. A flow that wants the row updated must return it.

### 2.3d Conditional cell formatting — DESIGNED 2026-09-19, NOT BUILT

Declarative per-column formatting rules: when a condition matches, colour the
cell and optionally add an icon. Replaces the Cell Attributes JSON box, which is
the thing an admin currently cannot use.

Everything below was measured with `repro/datatable-cell-colour/`, over two
rounds and six surfaces. **Read that README before touching this** — nearly
every assumption we started with turned out to be wrong.

#### Why the current mechanism does not work

To colour a cell today an admin types `{"class": {"fieldName": "Helper__c"}}`
into Cell Attributes. That needs four undocumented things known at once, and
then still fails: `buildRows` copies only the key, `Id` and the DISPLAYED column
paths into a row, so the helper field is not there unless it is itself a visible
column. The datatable cannot hide a column. So the escape hatch is a dead end
for the use case it exists for.

#### What we measured

1. **Component CSS cannot reach inside `lightning-datatable`. A static resource
   loaded with `loadStyle` can** — verified on a record page AND in an LWR site.
   Round 1 concluded the opposite and was wrong: it tested component CSS. The
   component we replace ships exactly such a stylesheet, headed "style sheet to
   bypass shadow dom", and uses it for datatable hover rules.
2. **`slds-theme_*` is unusable.** It is an SLDS 1 construct and rendered five
   different ways across Flow debug, SLDS 1, SLDS 2 light, SLDS 2 dark and LWR —
   `slds-theme_warning` loses its background entirely under SLDS 2 light,
   `slds-theme_inverse` inverts in dark mode, `slds-theme_info` is invisible in
   LWR. It also bundles a text colour that cannot be separated from the
   background.
3. **It breaks on hover, and that was the real bug.** The theme class sets a
   background and a text colour; the datatable's row hover repaints the
   background and the white text survives on top of it. Captured on
   `slds-theme_inverse`: white on light grey, value gone. Rows given a hover
   rule held; rows without one broke. Nothing to do with branding sets.
4. **SLDS 2 global styling hooks are the answer.** They come in guaranteed pairs
   — `--slds-g-color-<x>-container-1` for the background and
   `--slds-g-color-on-<x>-1` documented as the text colour for it — each with
   its own light and dark value. That is the contrast guarantee `slds-theme_*`
   never had. They also restore blue, which the theme set could not reach.
5. **The icon follows the cell's text colour.** `cellAttributes` has no
   `iconColor` (confirmed against the component reference), and
   `--slds-c-icon-color-foreground` set on our host did not reach the
   datatable's icons. So there is no separate icon colour control, and none
   would make sense.
6. **Type formatting survives.** Currency stayed `$25,000.00`, right-aligned,
   under every class.

#### The design

Flow Grid ships its own classes in a static resource, coloured from SLDS 2 hooks
with SLDS 1 fallbacks, each with a matching hover rule, every selector scoped
under `c-fgrid_flow-grid`:

```css
c-fgrid_flow-grid .fgridFormat_error,
c-fgrid_flow-grid .slds-table tbody tr:hover > td .fgridFormat_error {
    background-color: var(--slds-g-color-error-container-1, #fddde3);
    color: var(--slds-g-color-on-error-1, #b60554);
}
```

Palette: Error, Warning, Success, Accent (blue), Neutral. **Do not use
`--slds-g-color-disabled-container-1` for the neutral** — it is near-illegible
grey-on-grey in LWR, correctly, because those tokens are for disabled UI that is
meant to recede. Try `--slds-g-color-surface-container-2` with
`--slds-g-color-on-surface-1`.

Controls are named semantically — **Success, never Green**. A control labelled
Green renders teal under SLDS 2 dark and pale mint under SLDS 2 light. For the
same reason Grid Studio's preview must render live rather than draw a fixed
swatch: a static swatch would be wrong on four surfaces out of five.

Rule grammar mirrors Salesforce's own conditional formatting, so it is familiar
and so importing rulesets stays mechanical if that ever becomes worthwhile:
ordered rules, first match wins, each with conditions of field + operator +
value and an All / Any / Custom / Always selector matching `booleanFilter`.
Conditions may test **any column, not only the one being formatted** — that is
what native does, confirmed from its editor.

#### Build order — none of it started

1. **The static resource.** Five semantic classes plus text-only variants, each
   with its hover rule.
2. **The rule model** on `columnConfig`. Reuse `FILTER_OPERATOR` and
   `operatorsFor` — the filter row already has the whole operator vocabulary,
   tested.
3. **Evaluation** in `buildRows`, writing a synthetic `<field>__fgridFormat`
   value per row; `buildColumns` points `cellAttributes.class` at it. Includes
   extending the paths list so a rule can test a column that is not displayed.
4. **The editor** — per-column Formatting Rules in Grid Studio, live preview.

1–3 are the engine and are Jest-testable. 4 needs a deploy to judge.

#### Reverses the `loadStyle` rejection, deliberately

§1.4's toast work records `loadStyle` as rejected: "a distributed package should
not restyle a customer's whole site." That was about an `!important` rule
fighting platform chrome. Here every selector is scoped under our own tag, so
nothing outside the component can be affected. The objection stands for the
toast case and does not apply to this one.

### 2.3e Native Conditional Field Formatting — INVESTIGATED AND DECLINED 2026-09-19

Whether Flow Grid could read the rulesets an admin already defines in Setup
(Dynamic Forms conditional formatting) rather than making them redefine
everything. Measured in the org; the answer is no, for a reason that will not
change on its own.

**The data is good.** `UiFormatSpecificationSet` is object- and field-scoped
rather than welded to a Lightning page, and the condition grammar is closed and
simple — `criteria[]` of `leftValue` / `operator` / `rightValue` plus a
`booleanFilter`, with `{!Record.Field}` on the left. No formula engine needed.

**It is unreachable from Apex.** Measured three ways:

```
plain SOQL         -> sObject type 'UiFormatSpecificationSet' is not supported.
Apex describe      -> Schema.getGlobalDescribe() does not contain it
Apex Metadata API  -> Metadata.MetadataType.values() is exactly three types:
                      OmniInteractionAccessConfig, CustomMetadata, Layout
```

It lives in the Tooling API, which Salesforce does not project into Apex. Reading
it at runtime therefore needs an HTTP callout with a Named Credential —
`UserInfo.getSessionId()` is rejected for API callouts from a Lightning context.

**And it only draws an icon.** `FormatType` is a picklist whose complete set of
values is `['ICON']`, on both the set and the specification. It cannot colour or
shade anything, so it was never an alternative source for the cell formatting in
2.3d — only for the icon half.

**Declined**: a Named Credential dependency plus a Tooling callout, to import
rules that can only place an icon, while we build our own engine for the colour
regardless. Revisit if `FormatType` ever gains a background or text value — the
grammar in 2.3d is deliberately shaped like theirs so that mapping would be
mechanical.

Worth knowing: its six colours are a fixed palette stored as names, not a hex
picker — Gray `#747474`, Blue `#0176D3`, Green `#2E844A`, Orange `#DD7A01`, Red
`#BA0517`, Purple `#9050E9`. Being fixed hex, they presumably do not adapt to
dark mode, which is an argument for our hook-based approach over copying theirs.

### 2.4 Resource-capable Boolean properties — DROPPED 2026-08-25

Every checkbox in the editor stores a literal, so none can be bound to
`$GlobalConstant.True` or a Flow formula the way the platform's own Boolean
properties can. This was logged as work because `markActionedRows` needed it —
and that property has since been deleted, so the item lost its only concrete
justification.

Dropped by decision. The limitation is real but nothing currently needs it.
Reinstate if a property turns up that has to take a Flow reference; the shape of
the fix is a control type using the kit's literal-or-resource input, plus runtime
handling for a value that may arrive as either.

## 2.5 Parity gaps against the original datatable

Reviewed 2026-08-25 against the baseline's `datatable.js-meta.xml` and its README
release notes. The unofficialsf.com feature page returns 403 to automated
fetching, so the repo was used as the source — it is the authoritative one anyway.

**Property parity is complete.** All 83 non-legacy baseline properties have a
counterpart among Flow Grid's 81. Every gap below is behavioural.

Nothing here is scheduled. Deferred by decision, not oversight.

### Bug

- **`flex` does nothing.** `fgrid_columnConfig` offers a Flex checkbox per column
  and `buildColumns` never reads it — 11 of the 12 offered attributes are
  consumed. The baseline treated fixed-versus-floating column width as a real
  feature. Small fix.

### Missing behaviour, roughly by risk

0. **Record-type-aware picklist values — not implemented.** `recordTypeId` and
   `showAllPicklistValues` are accepted properties that nothing reads.
   `FlowGridColumnService.picklistOptionsOf` returns every _active_ value on the
   field, org-wide, so an editable picklist on an object with record types offers
   values the user is not allowed to pick — and saving one produces a validation
   failure at DML time, away from the grid. Fixing it means decoding `validFor`
   bitmaps in Apex; `getPicklistValues` from `uiObjectInfoApi` is the cleaner tool
   but needs one wire per field, which does not work for N dynamic columns.
   Dependent picklists (a controlling field filtering the options) are a separate,
   larger piece and explicitly out of scope.

1. **Timezone offset on Date and Time — REASSESSED 2026-08-27. Mostly not a gap, and
   porting the baseline's fix would have made it worse.**

    This was carried for weeks as the highest-risk gap, on the grounds that the
    baseline adjusts dates by the running user's offset, pins to noon to dodge DST,
    stores `YYYY-MM-DD`, and reapplies the offset on edit — while Flow Grid did none
    of it. The conclusion was wrong, because the two designs are not comparable.

    **The baseline's offsets compensate for its own conversion.** It turns a Date into
    a timestamp on input (`Date.parse(value + "T12:00:00.000Z")` minus the user's
    offset) and therefore has to undo that on output. It even tried `date-local` and
    backed out — the code is still there, commented, at `datatable.js:1311-1314`, with
    a later note about handling `date-local` "like regular date". Flow Grid never does
    that conversion, so there is nothing to compensate for.

    **`date-local` is the platform's own answer.** The component reference describes it
    as `lightning-formatted-date-time` with `day`/`month`/`year` and **no timezone
    conversion**, and the `lightning-formatted-date-time` docs say plainly: "When using
    the component to display a date only, without time, include `time-zone="UTC"` to
    ensure the correct date displays in all time zones." Our Apex already maps
    `DATE → date-local` and `DATETIME → date`, which is exactly that split.

    **Time needs nothing either.** `lightning-formatted-time` documents that "time is
    always displayed in Universal Time" and that offsets are ignored — `14:30+05:00` is
    treated as `14:30` — which is the correct reading of a wall-clock time of day.

    **What is genuinely still unverified:** editing a DATETIME. That column is type
    `date`, which DOES convert to the user's zone for display, so an edit has to return
    to UTC. Worth testing rather than assuming, and it is a much narrower question than
    the gap this entry used to describe. A DATE column, on `date-local`, should
    round-trip untouched.

    Do NOT port the baseline's offset arithmetic without first proving a defect. It
    would introduce the shift it was written to cancel.

    **Implemented 2026-08-27, once the docs settled what the types actually do**
    (`fgrid_gridModel.js`, buildColumns):

    - A DATETIME column now defaults to `year`/`month`/`day`/`hour`/`minute`
      typeAttributes. Without them the component uses a medium **date** format, so a
      Datetime displayed as "Apr 18, 2024" and its time was simply invisible — visible
      in the Created Date column of the org. Defaults, not overrides: an admin's own
      `typeAttribs` still win.
    - A DATE column given `typeAttribs` switches from `date-local` to `date` with
      `timeZone: "UTC"` forced (unless the admin set a timezone deliberately).
      `date-local` **ignores typeAttributes entirely**, so custom formatting has to move
      to `date` — and plain `date` converts a date-only value into the running user's
      zone, which is the one case where the wrong day really can show. Pinning to UTC is
      what the reference prescribes for a date-only value.
    - A plain DATE column stays on `date-local` with no typeAttributes at all. That is
      the no-conversion path and it is the default, so the common case is untouched.

    Five tests in `fgrid_gridModel.test.js` ("date and datetime formatting") cover both
    defaults, both admin overrides, and the UTC pin.

    **VERIFIED 2026-08-27 — the gap is closed.** All three types were edited and saved
    against a debug payload:

    - DATE — saved `"2026-09-03"`, displayed `Sep 3, 2026`. Untouched, as `date-local`
      promises.
    - DATETIME — saved `"2026-09-02T19:45:00.000Z"`, displayed `03:45 PM` in a UTC-4
      user zone. The edit went in as local wall-clock time and came back out as correct
      UTC, with no arithmetic on our side.
    - TIME — saved `"01:00:00.000"`, displayed `1:00:00 AM`.

    This settles it: the offset arithmetic this entry once demanded would have
    introduced a shift into a round-trip that is already correct. Leave it alone.

2. **Multi-currency conversion — accepted and ignored.** `suppressCurrencyConversion`
   exists as a property but nothing implements conversion. The baseline converts
   currency values to the user's currency and supports currency rollup and formula
   fields in multi-currency orgs. Only matters if the target org is multi-currency.
3. ~~**Lookup fields are not links.**~~ **CLOSED 2026-08-25.** Lookup columns now
   show the related record's name and link to it, both as per-column Display
   Options matching the standard datatable, and are editable through a record
   picker. See §2.1 Stage C. Remaining caveat: the name is read off the record, so
   a Flow that never queried the relationship still shows the Id.
4. **Rich text renders as escaped markup.** The baseline ships a dedicated rich
   text cell type; Flow Grid maps TEXTAREA to `text`.
5. **No runtime Clip/Wrap per column.** The baseline lets the user toggle
   wrap/clip from the column header menu at runtime. Flow Grid has only the
   design-time `wrap` attribute.
6. **Percent fields untested.** The baseline documents `.25 = 25%` and locale
   handling, and had repeated bugs here. Display maps PERCENT to the datatable's
   `percent` type, which expects a fraction, so it is probably correct but
   unverified. Editing is where the baseline struggled — relevant when inline
   editing is built.

### Open questions

- **Apex-defined types — REASSESSED 2026-09-19, the gap is much smaller than
  recorded.** The entry below used to say the baseline treats Apex-defined as a
  first-class typed mode while Flow Grid only takes serialized JSON. That is
  wrong, and it was overstating the work.

    **The baseline takes a String too.** Its inputs are `tableDataString` and
    `preSelectedRowsString`, both `type="String"`, with a matching set of `*String`
    outputs. There is no Apex-typed property anywhere in its metadata. Its CPE
    labels the flag "Input data is Apex-Defined" while the property is named
    `isUserDefinedObject` — one feature, two names. "Apex-Defined" describes where
    the JSON usually comes FROM (an invocable action returning a serialized class),
    not the parameter type.

    So Flow Grid is at parity on the input, and ahead on the output: it already
    ships JSON mirrors for selected, edited, removed, remaining and actioned.

    A genuine Apex-defined input would mean `type="apex://SomeClass[]"`, which is a
    real Flow capability — several components in this repo use it. It is not
    available to a datatable, because it names ONE class at design time and there
    is no generic Apex-defined type the way `{T[]}` is generic over SObjects. Any
    real support therefore means a wrapper class consumers extend, which is a
    design question, not a missing feature. Still sequenced after inline editing,
    but no longer blocking parity.

    Original text, kept because the sequencing decision stands: "DECIDED
    2026-08-25: genuine support is needed... it needs a real design pass, not an
    incremental patch, and it interacts with inline editing."

- **Filters: header actions or a filter row?** The baseline puts Set Filter and
  Clear Filter in each column's header menu. Flow Grid uses a filter row above the
  table — simpler and more discoverable, but a different mental model for anyone
  migrating.
- **Reactive `preSelectedRecords` — DECIDED 2026-08-25: make it reactive.**
  Resolved into the wider "incoming data is authoritative" rule. See §2.6.

### Deliberately not carried over

- **Clipboard copy of attribute strings** — a wizard convenience for the 13
  delimited column strings. Obsolete now that column config is JSON.
- **The `YYYY-MM-DD` search format note** — the baseline had to document it. Flow
  Grid substring-matches raw values and dates arrive as ISO strings, so the same
  format works incidentally. No action, but the constraint is the same.

## 2.14 Studio workspace and column widths — 2026-09-05

The Studio modal migration is §3.2. Everything else from that day:

### Collapsible settings pane, and Preview Size

A chevron leading the banner row hides the left pane so the preview and the column
attribute grid can use the full modal width. A **Preview Size** combobox — Large,
Medium, Small — narrows the simulated grid, mirroring Flow Builder's own Preview Size
control so an admin does not learn a second idiom. It frames the whole simulated grid,
toolbar and filter pills and pagination included, because all of it reflows.

Neither is a Flow property. Both are view preferences for one sitting, and the grid's
runtime width comes from wherever the flow is embedded. Persisting the collapsed pane
would mean an admin's next visit opened with no settings visible.

The Medium and Small widths (`40rem`, `20rem`) are **ours**, not the platform's. SLDS 2
defines modal widths as viewport fractions inside `slds-plus.css`, which a component
stylesheet cannot read, and Flow Builder publishes no widths. Measured in the org:
`medium` 39% of viewport, `large` 89%. Large is deliberately unconstrained — the preview
already sits inside a large modal, so pinning it to a fraction would make the default
narrower than its own pane. One `PREVIEW_SIZES` constant if they need adjusting.

The panes scroll independently again via `max-height: calc(85vh - 11rem)` on
`.studio__content`. That clamp is what makes each pane's `overflow-y: auto` engage; it
was dropped during the modal migration on the reasoning that `lightning-modal-body`
owns the height, and without it the panes grew to their content and the whole modal
body scrolled. The height has to be a viewport fraction because the modal body is in
another shadow root and sizes itself with a `max-height`, so `height: 100%` would not
resolve against it. The `rem` subtraction models the platform chrome, which is absolute
rather than proportional, so it degrades in the right direction on a short viewport. If
there is dead space below the panes, raise the `85vh`; if a second scrollbar appears
beside a pane's own, lower it.

### Column widths — `min-column-width`, not `column-widths-mode`

**Negative result, recorded so nobody repeats it.** `column-widths-mode="auto"` does
**not** stop columns collapsing in a narrow container. It reallocates the _available_
width by content rather than letting columns claim their natural width and overflow, so
a narrow container still squeezes. Tried in the preview at Medium and Small, both by
switching after render and by mounting in `auto` from the start; no improvement either
way. Turning per-column Wrap off made no difference either. The premise was also wrong
to begin with: there was no "auto-fit" setting in play, because no width attributes were
set at all — the collapse was the datatable's plain default.

The only lever is `min-column-width`, whose platform default of 50px is precisely what
the columns were collapsing to. `MIN_COLUMN_WIDTH = 100` in `fgrid_gridModel`, bound on
both the runtime grid and the Studio preview so a narrow preview degrades by the runtime
rule and cannot flatter it. The default mode already fills the container, so columns
still expand when there is room; the floor only bites when there is not, and then the
table scrolls.

The trade is real and was accepted knowingly: a wide grid that previously squeezed to
fit will now scroll horizontally. A scrollbar is legible and a 50px column is not.

### Toolbar: shrink, then wrap

The header title and the search collided at narrow widths. The search is now the elastic
element — `flex: 1 1 20rem` with an `11rem` floor — so it gives up width first; past that
the row wraps and the search takes its own line. Wrapping rather than truncating, for the
reason the filter pills already state: horizontal space is the scarce resource in an
Experience Cloud column, vertical space is not.

The Studio's preview toolbar was missing the `flex: 1 1 auto; min-width: 0` that the
runtime grid's title block always had — its title was a bare `<div>` — so the preview
degraded _worse_ than the runtime it is meant to predict. `min-width: 0` is the
load-bearing part: a flex item's automatic minimum is its min-content width, so without
it the title refuses to yield and shoves the search out of the row.

### Preview table renders once, after the first sample

The Studio sometimes opened with a narrow table that snapped wider a moment later. The
datatable fixes its column widths on the render that creates it and does not revisit
them, and it was being created with fabricated rows while the modal was still animating
in — `lightning/modal` scales as it opens, and a transform skews
`getBoundingClientRect` without changing layout width. Real records then forced a second
render, which recomputed wider. The grid box now holds a spinner until the first sample
resolves, keeping its configured height so nothing jumps vertically. Only the first load
is gated; a later refetch keeps the existing table on screen rather than flickering.

The animation timing is inference, not measurement — `getBoundingClientRect`
mid-animation is not observable from a test. What is established is that the table
rendered pre-load and re-rendered on arrival, which is enough to explain a recompute.

### Title Style — SHIPPED AND REMOVED THE SAME DAY

A picklist of H1–H6 plus Body, setting the header title's size and heading level. Removed
within the hour: seven sizes for a header title is the kind of choice SLDS exists to
remove, and the only thing it could reliably produce was grids inconsistent with each
other. The header is back to `<h2 class="slds-text-heading_small">`, byte-identical to
before the attempt.

Three things worth keeping from it:

1. **SLDS resets native headings globally** — `h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { font-weight: inherit;
font-size: 1em }`. A bare heading tag has no size of its own and the platform will not
   style it. What styles the rich text component's `h1..h6` is a scoped opt-in class,
   `.slds-rich-text-editor__output`, which restores a ladder for its own subtree only:
   h1 1.5rem, h2 1.125rem/700, h3 1.125rem, h4 0.875rem/700, h5 0.875rem, h6 0.75rem/700.
   That class belongs to a component blueprint, not to us.
2. **The canonical answer for this header, if it is ever restyled**, is
   `.slds-card__header-title` — 1rem at weight 700, themeable org-wide through
   `--slds-c-card-heading-font-size` and `--slds-c-card-heading-font-weight`. It was not
   adopted only because it would make the title bold, a visual change nobody asked for.
   The original `slds-text-heading_small` got the size right (1rem) by accident: it was
   written in the first Flow Grid commit with no recorded reasoning, and the datatable
   this replaced never rendered a visible title at all — `tableLabel` was only ever an
   `aria-label` on the table element.
3. **`--slds-g-font-scale-*` is the real typography surface**, verified against the SLDS
   hook index rather than inferred: neg-2 0.625rem, neg-1 0.75rem, 1 0.875rem, 2 1rem,
   3 1.25rem, 4 1.5rem, 5 1.75rem, 6 2rem. `--slds-g-font-size-N` does **not** exist;
   only `--slds-g-font-size-base` and that ladder. Weights are `--slds-g-font-weight-1`
   through `-7` for 100–700. **`design/pagination-mockup.html` claims to use "verified
   global styling hooks" and its fallbacks are wrong** — it has `font-scale-2, 1.125rem`
   when the value is 1rem, and `font-scale-1, 1rem` when it is 0.875rem. That file loads
   SLDS 1 from unpkg, where none of those hooks are defined, so only the fallbacks ever
   applied and nobody noticed. Do not trust that comment.

### Shipping a property is close to irreversible — hit twice now

Removing `titleStyle` failed on deploy:

> The targetConfig is missing a property that's referenced in these flow versions:
> 'Flow Grid Smoke Test-8'. Add this property to the targetConfig: 'titleStyle'

A **saved flow version pins a `targetConfig` property permanently**, and a declared
property needs a matching `@api` or the component cannot be set. This is the second time
the trap has been hit. The interim fix is to keep the property declared but out of
`fgrid_propertySchema`, so nothing writes it and the editor does not show it.

Dropping it for real required deleting the flow version that referenced it. All eight
versions were checked individually first — only v8 did, matching the error.
`FlowGrid_Smoke_Test` is now **tracked in the project** at
`flowgrid/force-app/main/default/flows/`, retrieved before the delete; note
`sf project retrieve` put it in the _default_ package directory, not `flowgrid/`, so it
had to be moved. Redeploying the cleaned copy **replaced the remaining draft rather than
creating a new version**, so the smoke test kept v8's configuration minus the property.

**The lesson: be slower to add a property than to add behaviour.** A setting can only be
withdrawn cleanly before anyone saves a flow with it.

## 2.13 Record-type and dependent picklists — 2026-08-27

Two properties had been declared, offered in the editor, and documented in the code as
"accepted and inert" since the beginning. Both are now real, and they were built
together because **dependent picklists force the same machinery anyway**: narrowing by a
controlling field is inherently per row, and the data for both arrives in one payload.

### What an admin sees

```
Filter Picklists by Record Type   ( ) Do Not Filter  ( ) Globally  ( ) Per Row
Record Type Id                    <- Globally only
Dependent Picklist Icon           <- default utility:hierarchy
```

`showAllPicklistValues` is gone from the editor: "Do Not Filter" says the same thing
explicitly. It survives as a deprecated shim for the same reason `wrapTextMaxLines`
does — a saved flow version pins the declaration.

### How it works

- **Apex names the pairing.** `DescribeFieldResult.getController()` reports each
  picklist's controlling field. Only Apex knows this; the UI API payload carries the
  dependency DATA but never says which field is the controller.
- **One wire per distinct record type**, through `c/fgrid_picklistValues` — a component
  that renders nothing and exists only because a wire adapter takes one id and a
  component cannot loop wires.
- **Record types come off the RECORDS, not the rows.** `RecordTypeId` is rarely a
  displayed column, and a Get Records set to store all fields already carries it. If
  the Get did not retrieve it, filtering is skipped rather than firing a 2000-id query
  to go and get it.
- **Dependent picklists work with filtering OFF.** `validFor` lives in the same payload,
  so one fetch against the master record type happens whenever any column is dependent.
  The mode governs record-type filtering only, which is what its label promises.
- **A locked cell.** A dependent picklist whose controlling value is blank offers
  nothing, and an empty list disables the combobox with "Set Type first". Salesforce
  shows an empty dropdown and leaves the user guessing.
- **An UNSAVED controlling value counts.** A record page narrows the dependent picklist
  the moment the controlling one is chosen, not when it is saved. Committed edits
  already reach `buildRows` through `allKnownRecords`, but a draft sitting in the
  Cancel/Save bar does not, so the context reads it from `draftFieldValues` and it wins
  over the stored value. Clearing the controller in a draft locks the cell again.

    Drafts arrive keyed by `columnKey`, so this path needs the same translation the save
    path does — both now share one `fieldByColumnKey` getter rather than building the map
    twice.

    The rows memo only depends on drafts when a dependent column exists, so a grid
    without one does not rebuild every row on every cell edit.

### Why 2000 records is affordable

The costs scale with **record types**, not rows:

| Dimension          | Scales with                                | At 2000 records |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Wire calls         | distinct record types                      | 1-5             |
| Option lists built | record types x fields x controlling values | a few dozen     |
| Per row            | one Map lookup                             | trivial         |

Option lists are cached by `recordTypeId|field|controllingValue`, and rows resolving the
same way share ONE array instance — which matters twice, because identical identity is
also what stops the datatable treating every row as changed on re-render.

Prerequisite, left to the admin by decision: the controlling field must be in the
collection. We cannot check every scenario, and a dependent picklist with no
controlling value simply locks.

### Verified in a browser — 2026-08-27

Working against a real object. That covers the structurally novel part: the fan-out
children do resolve their wires inside a running Flow screen, and `validFor` arrives in
the shape assumed from the reference.

## 2.12 `disableColumnResize` removed — 2026-08-27

Unlike `allowOverflow` (§2.11) this property WORKED — it is a documented pass-through
to `resize-column-disabled`. Removing it was a product decision, not dead-code
cleanup, and reverting is five lines.

The reasoning: it only ever removes capability from the end user. A dragged width is
per-session and non-destructive, nothing in the grid depends on resizing being
off, and the reference notes the table keeps adapting to container width even when the
attribute is set — so it never protected a layout, it only stopped a drag.

Resizing itself stays, along with the `_columnWidths` persistence that makes a dragged
width survive a rebuild (§2.9). If a case for locking columns turns up — a touch
layout where drag handles interfere is the most plausible — this is the property to
reinstate.

### Selection reworked to match the native panel — 2026-08-27

| Control                          | Property                      | Shown when                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Row selection mode               | `selectionMode`               | always — Multiple / Single / **View only** |
| Minimum selection                | `minSelection` _(new)_        | Multiple                                   |
| Maximum selection                | `maxSelection` _(new)_        | Multiple                                   |
| Require user to make a selection | `isRequired`                  | **Single only**                            |
| Selection control                | `singleSelectControl` _(new)_ | Single — Radio button / Checkbox           |
| Unique identifier                | `keyField`                    | moved here from the data source            |

**A stored value outlives the mode that set it.** Flow keeps any property it was given,
and the editor only stops SHOWING a control when the mode changes — it does not clear
the value. So a grid switched from Multiple to View only was still demanding
`minSelection` rows the user had no way to pick, and the screen could not be advanced
at all. `requiredSelectionCount` now returns 0 whenever the grid is not selectable.

Worth generalising: any control gated by `when:` can leave a value behind. The RUNTIME
has to gate on the same condition, not just the editor.

**Verified in the org 2026-08-27 — all three modes.** Multiple: selecting one record
at a time across several pages stops at the maximum with every remaining row disabled;
a maximum below the minimum is refused by the input's floor; a minimum forces a
selection before the screen will advance. Single: radio and checkbox both work, and
the checkbox can be unticked. View only: no selection column at all.

`maxRowSelection` was a derived getter (1 for Single, unlimited otherwise); it now
honours `maxSelection` for Multiple. `validate()` and the inline message understand a
minimum, so Multiple can demand N rows rather than just one.

**`isRequired` is Single-only now.** For Multiple, a Minimum of 1 says exactly the same
thing, and two controls meaning one thing is how a panel gets confusing.

**The Clear Selection button is gone entirely**, and with it
`hideClearSelectionButton`. The reasoning, arrived at by working backwards from where
it was needed:

- **Multiple** — the datatable's own header checkbox selects and clears all. The button
  was redundant.
- **Single** — a radio CANNOT be cleared once chosen, in the datatable or in plain HTML,
  and it lives in the shadow DOM so no handler can intercept the click. The button was
  the only escape. But `single-row-selection-mode="checkbox"` is the platform's own
  answer to that, which is what the Selection control now exposes.

So every mode is clearable by native means and no bespoke selection UI remains. An
admin who picks Radio and wants clearing has no way — the same position the native
datatable takes.

**Presentation, after seeing it in the panel.** Row selection mode renders as a RADIO
group rather than a combobox — few options, and the choice steers the rest of the
section, so all three stay readable instead of hiding behind a closed picker. Minimum
and Maximum sit side by side, because they are one setting expressed as two numbers.

Minimum and Maximum are `CONTROL.INTEGER`, a third editor addition: a plain number
input that does NOT go through the kit's value input, so it cannot take a Flow
resource. Deliberate — a bound formula could not be checked against the minimum, and
"how many rows may I pick" is not a question a formula answers. Whole numbers only, no
negatives, blank clears rather than storing 0 (a minimum of 0 is a deliberate "no
minimum"; blank is an unanswered question). `minFrom` reads the floor off another
property, so **Maximum can never be set below Minimum** — a maximum under the minimum
could never be satisfied.

Both needed additions to the editor: a `CONTROL.RADIO` type, and an `inline` flag on a
descriptor that halves its width. The controls are now laid out in a flex row rather
than as stacked divs, so `inline` is a schema decision rather than a CSS special case
— reusable for the next natural pair.

**The default stayed Multiple.** It was briefly changed to Single, then changed back:
the native table starts on Multiple, and matching it is worth more than a preference.

**A reversal worth naming.** `singleSelectAsCheckbox` was removed earlier the same day
as redundant with Clear Selection. That was wrong: the two were alternative answers to
one problem, not a workaround and a fix. It returns as `singleSelectControl`, a
Radio/Checkbox choice rather than a Boolean.

**And a test that asserted a bug.** "Offers Clear Selection only for single-row
selection" pinned the editor hiding a switch for a button the runtime showed in every
mode. Third time today a green test proved nothing — see also the flow-variables loop
and the `getRecordsByIds` mock.

### Width has no helper actions — decided 2026-08-27

Two were built and both removed the same hour. Recorded so neither is proposed again
without a reason that survives the objections below.

**Capture-on-drag** offered to write the widths dragged in the Studio preview into
Width. It wrote a width for EVERY column rather than the one dragged — my diff compared
each resize against a previous-widths snapshot that started empty, so on the first drag
everything differed from `undefined`. That bug was trivial to fix and is not why it
went: dragging a divider gives no signal about whether the LEFT or the RIGHT column is
being resized, so capture would be guessing at intent however the diff behaved.

**Reset to auto** cleared every Width in one click. It worked and was tested, but a
button in the header earns its place only if clearing eight fields by hand is a real
chore, and it is not — the fields are right there and "Reset all attributes" already
exists above the table.

Width is a plain number field: type a value, clear it for auto. Nothing else.

### Wrapped Lines is a switch — SLDS 2 hardcodes the clamp

**The mechanism, from the Styles panel** (`slds-plus.css:28408`):

```css
.slds-line-clamp {
    overflow: hidden;
    display: -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 3; /* a literal. no var(), no styling hook */
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    white-space: pre-line;
}
```

The datatable takes `wrap-text-max-lines` and writes it on the cell wrapper as
`--lwc-lineClamp`, alongside that class:

```html
<div class="slds-hyphenate slds-line-clamp" style="--lwc-lineClamp: 6"></div>
```

**Nothing reads `--lwc-lineClamp`.** SLDS 2 clamps at a hardcoded three, so the count
cannot be honoured by any means available to a consumer — and the class exists only
because the attribute is set at all. The two achievable states are therefore three
lines, or unlimited. Hence a checkbox, **Limit Wrapped Text to Three Lines**, and the
runtime sends the literal `"3"` or nothing.

Worth knowing this is a platform-wide break: `wrap-text-max-lines` does not work in any
SLDS 2 org, for any component.

#### Four wrong turns, and the ordering that would have avoided them

1. Passed a NUMBER where the reference asks for "a string value representing a number".
   A real defect, fixed — but fixing it changed nothing visible, which was the moment to
   measure rather than theorise again.
2. Concluded three was a platform floor and converted the control to a switch. Right
   answer, no evidence.
3. Reverted it when the reference was re-read: "to show a number of lines", three only
   as its example. Correct reasoning, wrong conclusion.
4. Overrode `--slds-g-font-line-clamp`, the SLDS 2 styling hook, on the assumption that
   the clamp read a variable. It does not. Dead code, now removed.

**The ordering that works, and it is three steps:** confirm the value is stored (Tooling
API), confirm it reaches the element (inspector), then **read the RULE, not the computed
value**. Step three names the mechanism. A filter on "clamp" in the Computed panel
showed only the custom properties and no `-webkit-line-clamp`, which was itself the
clue that the property was not where it was assumed to be.

#### TODO — remove the `wrapTextMaxLines` shim

Deprecated, unread, absent from the property editor, still declared in `js-meta.xml`
and as an `@api`. Salesforce refuses to deploy a targetConfig that drops a property a
saved flow version references, then refuses one with no matching `@api` — so a single
stored value pins it. To finish: clear it from every flow version that holds it, verify
with a Tooling API `SELECT Metadata FROM Flow` grep, then drop both together.

### Text wrapping — one per-column checkbox, 2026-08-27

`Wrap` in Column attributes now controls that column's cells AND its header. The
grid-level "Wrap column headers" combobox is gone; `wrap-table-header` is hardcoded to
`by-column`.

**Why it collapses to one control.** The reference: "`by-column` wraps the header for
columns that have the Wrap text setting enabled and clips the header for columns that
have the Clip text setting enabled." There is exactly ONE per-column wrap flag
(`wrapText`), so separate "Wrap Header" and "Wrap Column" checkboxes would both write
to the same property. Header wrapping IS per-column — it just cannot be set
independently of the cells.

`wrap-text-max-lines` is table-level, so **Wrapped lines stays a grid setting**, not a
column one. It is clamped to 1-10 in the component rather than with `min`/`max` on the
input, because the editor routes a number through the kit's value input, which also
accepts a Flow resource — the value can arrive from a formula that no markup
constrains. Blank or unusable leaves the attribute unset, which wraps without
truncating. Headers always wrap in full; the limit is cells only.

**Also tidied:** a custom Label is capped at 255 characters and the Field and Label
columns were narrowed — the label input alone had been taking about a third of the row.
The cap was briefly 40, on the assumption that field labels are limited to 40; some
objects allow up to 255, so the component does not second-guess it. Whether a header
that long looks right is the admin's call.

Column attributes now read: Field, Label, Width, Align, Edit, Filter, Wrap.

### Column widths — simplified to one control, 2026-08-27

**A column's Width is now the only width setting.** `auto` (blank, the default) or a
number. Removed on the way here: the per-column `flex` checkbox, the grid-level "Size
columns to their content", and its Minimum/Maximum column width fields.

**What each state does**

- **`auto`** — the column shares the available space with the other auto columns, and
  reflows as they are pinned or the window resizes. This is what `flex` was asking for.
- **a number** — `initialWidth`, the admin's chosen width. Honoured exactly once there
  is nothing left to compress.

Verified in the org: adding widths one column at a time narrowed the remaining auto
columns, the last one stopped at the platform's 50px floor and began to overflow, and
once every column had a value the widths were exact and the table overflowed as
expected. Acceptable at every step, and all of it with content sizing OFF — the
configuration that turned out to be the good one.

**Why the global setting went.** It decided what `auto` MEANT — equal share versus
fit-to-content — which is a third dimension on top of a control that already reads
`auto` or a number. It was off by default, the default behaviour is the desirable one,
and content sizing shipped looking broken: it sizes a column to its DATA, so
`Account Rating` and `Employees` truncated their own headers at the 50px minimum.

**What was lost, knowingly.** Fit-to-content sizing. A per-column Width cannot
reproduce it — an admin now types a number instead of having the table measure. Judged
worth it: typing `100` is more predictable than hoping the measurement agrees with you,
and content sizing was never verified inside a Flow screen SECTION, which is the flex
container the reference says is unsupported.

**Min/max had a visibility bug worth recording.** `min-column-width` applies in fixed
mode too, but the editor only showed the fields when content sizing was on. They were
hidden in the mode where the attribute was still in effect. No behaviour impact, because
nothing was sent when hidden and the platform default of 50px applied — which is exactly
the floor observed in testing.

**Still true and unchanged:** after a manual resize the table can end up narrower than
its container, leaving dead space on the right. That is `lightning-datatable`'s own
behaviour inside its shadow DOM and is not reachable from here.

### The 300-record slowdown

Several seconds before a 300-record grid would respond. Two independent causes.

**Repeated recomputation.** LWC does not memoize getters, and the row pipeline is a
deep chain with eight template entry points — `rows`, `hasRows`, `isFilteredEmpty`,
`showPaginationBar`, `pageSummary`, `isFirstPage`, `isLastPage`, `headerCounts` —
each re-entering from the top. That meant `buildRows` running about nine times per
render over 300 records, `buildColumns` more than ten, each rebuilding
`describeByPath` from scratch. Now memoized per level, keyed on dependency identity,
which works because every mutable piece of state here is replaced rather than mutated.

The `columns` dependency list is long and explicit on purpose: a missing entry would
serve stale columns after a property-panel edit. That is the failure mode memoization
invites, so if a column setting stops taking effect, look there first.

Also hoisted a per-row allocation: `picklistCellOptions` built a `Set` of known
values for every row to answer a per-column question — 300 rows across two picklists
was 600 Sets per pass, times nine passes.

**Rendering every row.** `showPagination` defaulted to false, and with it off the grid
handed the datatable every matched row. The default configuration therefore rendered
300 rows of DOM. Replaced by `rowLoading`.

### Row loading: Scroll or Paginate

`rowLoading` — Scroll (default) or Paginate. There is deliberately no third
"render everything" mode: the standard datatable has none, and it was the old default.

Scroll renders 50 rows and grows by 50 on `loadmore`, synchronously — the records are
already in memory, so it is a rendering window, not a fetch. `enableInfiniteLoading`
switches off once the window covers everything. The window resets on search, filter,
clear, sort, and a genuinely new collection.

**Infinite loading would NOT have fixed the original slowness** and on its own is
slower: it is designed for server-side paging, and all 300 records are already in the
browser. What it fixes is the DOM cost of rendering everything.

`rowLoading` has no default in the contract — it lives in the runtime getter, per §4.
`showPagination` and `showFirstLastButtons` are deprecated and no longer read; both
remain declared only because a referenced property cannot be removed.

### Pagination controls

`c/fgrid_pagination`. SLDS ships no pagination blueprint — verified — and its
button-group blueprint explicitly excludes navigation, so this is the hierarchy's
"custom with hooks" tier: a `nav` landmark with list semantics, every value from a
verified `--slds-g-*` hook so org branding carries through. Zero SLDS linter
violations.

Truncation and page sizes are pure functions in `fgrid_gridModel`, testable without a
DOM:

- **Window of four** consecutive pages, leaning one before and two after — an even
  window cannot centre the current page. Page 1 and the last page are always shown.
- **No truncation at eight pages or fewer.** Not taste: the widest truncated form is
  eight slots (first, ellipsis, four window pages, ellipsis, last), so below nine
  pages truncating hides pages and saves nothing.
- **No ellipsis that hides nothing** — at page 2 the window already follows page 1.
- **Rows per page: 10, 25, 50, 100.** Stops short of list views' 200 because 200 rows
  is the DOM cost scroll mode exists to avoid. Options above `maxNumberOfRows` are
  dropped, since each would yield a single page. The admin's configured size is
  inserted if it is not a step, so a configured 15 stays representable rather than
  silently snapping to another value. Off by default via `showRowsPerPage`.

Numbers are centred with three grid tracks, not flexbox: with flex they drifted as
the summary text changed length between "1–10 of 314" and "311–314 of 314".

### Grid height — DECIDED 2026-08-27: stays fixed

`tableHeight` now always applies, defaulting to 30rem; it was previously only
PLACEHOLDER text, so the field looked populated while nothing was enforced.

Fixed rather than `max-height`, by decision: a stable layout on a page is worth more
than the blank space below a short page. `max-height` would remove the dead space but
move the footer as page contents differ in height. Do not revisit without a reason.

**No `overflow` is emitted.** `lightning-datatable` scrolls itself once its container
has a definite height, so adding `overflow: auto` stacked a second scroll container
outside the first, and the outer one reserved its own scrollbar gutter — visible as
dead space down the right edge beyond the scrollbar. Removing it also dissolved the
conflict with `allowOverflow` — and, unnoticed at the time, made that property a
no-op, since it set `overflow: visible` (the CSS default) on a wrapper that no longer
declares any overflow. `allowOverflow` was removed 2026-08-27; see §2.11.

---

## 2.9 Reviewed against the lightning-datatable reference — 2026-08-26

Read the component reference against what was built. Three defects found and fixed,
`flex` finally implemented, wrapping realigned, and the unused attributes wired.

### Defects fixed

- **Date editing: REVERSED 2026-08-27. Dates ARE editable.**
  On 2026-08-26 DATE/DATETIME/TIME were added to `NON_EDITABLE_TYPES` on the strength
  of a line in the component reference: _"Inline editing is not supported for date and
  location fields."_ That line is wrong, or at least stale — the date picker opens, the
  edit commits, and the grid shows the new value. Removed again.

    The lesson is the mistake, not the line: a documentation statement was treated as
    authoritative over testable behaviour, and a working feature was blocked as a
    result. Where the two disagree, test.

    **Audit fields need no list of their own.** Verified by describe in the org rather
    than assumed: `CreatedDate`, `LastModifiedDate`, `SystemModstamp`, `CreatedById`,
    `LastModifiedById` and `Id` all report `isUpdateable() == false`, which `isEditable`
    already honours — and since the veto below, a config tick cannot override that.
    The same check exposed `SLAExpirationDate__c` as `updateable=true` but blocked by
    the DATE entry, which is what proved the entry wrong.

    **CAUTION — functional but not yet safe.** Flow Grid still does not apply the
    running user's timezone offset (§2.5 gap 1), which is exactly where the component
    this replaces had repeated bugs. An edited date near midnight can save a day out.
    That gap matters more now that date editing is reachable.

- **A column config could override the describe and force a broken editor.**
  Fixed 2026-08-27. Adding types to that set only
  moves the DEFAULT — `buildColumns` resolved editability as
  `attributes.edit ?? (isEditable && defaultEditable)`, so an explicit tick still
  overrode it and still produced a broken cell. Found when a record Id column
  rendered a working text box over an 18-character key.

    The config now OPTS IN and the describe can VETO: `resolveEditable` refuses any
    field Salesforce reports as non-editable, whatever the column config says. That
    covers record Ids, formulas, auto-numbers, compound Address and Location fields,
    polymorphic lookups, and the date types. Absent a describe — a user-defined object,
    or the Studio preview before Apex answers — the config is still trusted, because
    there is nothing to check it against.

    The override existed only because MULTIPICKLIST and REFERENCE were once in that set
    and needed forcing past. Both have real editors now, so nothing legitimately needs
    to overrule the describe.

- **The `errors` attribute was unused.** Every failure was a banner above the grid,
  which cannot say WHICH row failed. `tableErrors` now attributes a failed row-action
  flow to its own row, and a describe failure to the table.
- **No `aria-label` on the datatable.** A screen reader announced an unlabelled grid.
  Now named from `tableLabel`, falling back to the object's plural label.

### `flex` REMOVED — 2026-08-27

Implemented earlier in the session on a misreading, then removed the same day once the
original component's release notes surfaced. Worth keeping the whole arc, because the
mistake was subtle and cost several rounds of browser testing.

**What Flex means, from the original author's v4.1.0 notes:**

> "When selected, all flexed columns' widths will evenly expand or contract to fill the
> available space... more control over columns that you specifically want to be narrow
> or wide while allowing the other columns to find the best fit."

So **Flex on = this column has no width of its own, share the space. Flex off = keep my
specific width.** The baseline implements exactly that — `setWidth` does
`flex_checked ? 0 : sizes[colNum]` and assigns `initialWidth` in both cases, never
`fixedWidth`. Flex and Width are two expressions of one idea.

**Why it is redundant here.** The baseline's Config Mode wizard MEASURES and stores a
width for every column, so it needed a per-column way to say "not this one". Our editor
never populates Width — it is blank, showing a placeholder of `auto`, unless an admin
types a number. An empty Width field already says everything Flex said.

**What the misreading cost.** Flex was implemented as `initialWidth` when on and
`fixedWidth` when off — resizable versus locked. Two things were wrong:

1. It invented a locked, non-reflowing column the original never had. `fixedWidth` is
   exact and refuses to reflow, so narrowing the window past the sum of the pinned
   columns forces horizontal overflow. Observed in the org.
2. It was a silent regression, recorded here at the time without the consequence being
   noticed: "a width set before this shipped was resizable and is now locked."

**Now:** a Width is ALWAYS `initialWidth` — a starting width that still expands and
contracts with the window or parent container. `fixedWidth` is not used anywhere. A
stored `flex` value is ignored, so old column configs need no migration.

**Lesson.** Three separate accounts of this attribute were given before the right one:
that it matched the reference's resizable/locked model, then that it was about container
reflow, then the correct one. All three were derived from OUR code and the platform
reference. The answer was in the original component's release notes the whole time —
read the source component's own documentation before reinterpreting one of its
attributes.

### Wrapping is on by default

Clipping hides data behind an ellipsis; wrapping reads better. `wrapText` is now
`attributes.wrap !== false`, so the config stores only explicit opt-outs.

Two things this had to respect:

- **Not every type can wrap.** The reference excludes `action`, `boolean`, `button`,
  `button-icon`, `date-local` and row numbers. `wrapText` is not set on those at all,
  so Wrap no longer appears to do something it cannot. DATE maps to `date-local`.
- **Our own custom cells were forcing a clip.** The picklist, multi-picklist and
  lookup display templates each wrapped their value in `slds-truncate`, which
  overrode whatever the standard cell layout wanted. Removed.

It also closes parity gap §2.5.5 for free: the datatable supplies Wrap text / Clip
text in the header menu natively, so runtime per-column control was never missing —
only `hideHeaderActions` suppresses it.

### Long text — editable via a textarea cell, 2026-08-27

`Description` came back from describe as `updateable=true` but `ourIsEditable=false`:
blocked by a rule refusing every non-sortable `TEXTAREA`. Third instance of the same
mistake in two days — refusing a field the platform allows.

Half-right, though. The datatable has no `textarea` cell type, so simply unblocking
it would give a SINGLE-LINE input over a 32,000-character field, flattening every
newline and saving it back that way. Silent data loss on a field whose purpose is
multi-line content.

`fgridLongText` is a fourth custom cell type: `lightning-textarea` as the edit
template, `maxLength` from the field's own describe rather than a guess. Applied only
when the column is editable, like the picklist cells — read-only it is
indistinguishable from text.

**Time renders through `lightning-formatted-time`.** An earlier version of this cell
hand-rolled `Intl.DateTimeFormat` on the belief that no such component existed. It
does. Its documented behaviour — locale formatting, always UTC, offsets ignored — is
exactly what a Time field needs, so the helper, its row field and its tests were all
deleted rather than maintained.

**Rich text stays read-only.** `isHtmlFormatted()` separates the two: Long Text Area
and Rich Text both present as non-sortable `TEXTAREA`, but rich text stores HTML and a
plain textarea would show and re-save raw markup. Blocked until §2.5 gap 4 has a real
editor.

**On the three SLDS warnings this raised.** 22rem, 6rem and an existing 12rem have no
hook equivalent. Rather than keep literals or delete the constraints, each was nudged
to the nearest step on the SLDS sizing scale — 20rem, 5rem, 10rem. Deleting a
constraint to satisfy the linter is what previously let the rows per page control
stretch across an entire grid track; the scale exists so sizes stay consistent, and
using it is better than either extreme.

### Attributes now wired

`column-widths-mode` (with min/max), `resize-column-disabled`, `wrap-table-header`,
`wrap-text-max-lines`, `single-row-selection-mode`, `errors`, `aria-label`,
`displayReadOnlyIcon`, `columnKey`, `step`, `linkify`, plus `onresize` and
`scrollToTop()`.

Two worth calling out:

- **`onresize` now persists dragged widths.** `columns` is rebuilt on every render,
  which resets the datatable's internal width state, so a resize was previously lost
  the moment anything else changed — paging, sorting, a filter. Dragged widths are
  kept by `columnKey` and re-applied as `initialWidth`, dropping any `fixedWidth` so
  a column the user has already dragged stays draggable.
- **`scrollToTop()` fires after a page change.** Moving to page two used to leave the
  viewport mid-table.
- **`wrapTextMaxLines` is table-level, not per column.** It had been offered as a
  per-column `otherAttribs` example, where it did nothing.

### Deliberately not done

- **`disabled-rows` — BUILT 2026-08-26** as a **Disabled records** collection input,
  sitting under Pre-selected records and mirroring it (with a JSON variant for the
  user-defined-object mode). Briefly declined, then reinstated once the real use case
  was named: `Status = Pending`. The Flow decides what unavailable means and passes
  the collection; SLDS greys the rows.

    This is the case the earlier decline got wrong. Filtering ineligible records out
    upstream hides them, and a user then wonders where a record went; greying it says
    why it is not on offer. Rows are matched by the key field, so no new plumbing.

    Unlike `preSelectedRecords` this needs no accessor: it is not user-mutable, so
    there is no local state for an incoming value to fight over. Worth knowing from the
    reference: a row that is both disabled and preselected still counts toward the
    selection limit.

- **`enable-infinite-loading`** is an alternative to pagination, not an addition;
  adopting it means choosing between the two.
- **Column-level `iconName`** (a header icon, distinct from `cellAttributes.iconName`
  which decorates every cell) is left alone by decision — revisit alongside column
  properties. Note this corrects an earlier claim in §2.8 that the datatable has no
  header-icon API: it does, and a filtered-column header marker is therefore
  possible. Pills remain the chosen reporting mechanism.
- Our column config's "Column icon" maps to `cellAttributes.iconName`, so it marks
  every CELL, not the header. The label implies otherwise. Unresolved.

## 2.8 Filters: header menu, operators, and pills

Rebuilt twice on 2026-08-25. The first attempt was a collapsible panel holding one
control per filterable column; it was rejected as a design and is gone
(`fgrid_filterPanel` deleted from the repo and the org). What shipped follows list
views and report builder instead.

**Entry point: the column's own header menu.** `column.actions` adds a "Filter…"
item and `onheaderaction` reports which column it came from. Native, costs no
horizontal space — which is the binding constraint in an Experience Cloud column —
and it is the only per-column affordance `lightning-datatable` actually offers.
There is no header-icon API; taking over the header would mean rebuilding column
resizing and the sort affordance by hand.

**Editor: `c/fgrid_filterEditor`, a narrow modal.** Operator plus Value — no Field
picker, because the column you opened the menu on IS the field. A popover anchored
to a header cell is not something the datatable supports, and hand-positioning one
inside a scrolling table lands in the same stacking trap as §3.2.

**Reporting: pills above the table.** This is the half of the feature that was
missing before. Each active filter renders as `Industry is one of Apparel ×`; the
label reopens its editor, the × removes it, and Clear all removes everything. Pills
wrap onto further lines rather than growing sideways. Without them a filter set from
a header menu is invisible the moment the menu closes.

Operators by kind, from `operatorsFor`:

| Kind     | Fields                          | Operators                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text     | text, email, phone, url, lookup | equals, not equal to, contains, does not contain, starts with             |
| picklist | picklist, multi-select          | is one of, is none of                                                     |
| number   | Currency, Number, Percent       | equals, not equal to, <, >, ≤, ≥                                          |
| date     | Date, Datetime                  | the six comparisons, plus is today / this week / last 30 days / this year |
| boolean  | Checkbox                        | equals True or False                                                      |

Plus **is blank / is not blank on every kind except boolean** — a Salesforce
checkbox is never null, so an "is blank" there could never match, and offering it
would be a lie. That is the one deliberate departure from "blanks on every type".

Decisions worth keeping:

- **One filter per column.** The header action edits that column's single filter and
  each column contributes at most one pill.
- **Picklist values combine with OR** ("is one of"); different columns combine with
  AND. `is none of` inverts the whole match, so a row holding any excluded value is
  dropped.
- **Dates compare on the date part only**, so a Datetime at 23:45 still counts as
  that day. A raw string comparison pushes it into the next one — there is a test
  pinning exactly this.
- **Relative dates are operators**, not a separate control, and they carry the
  `{ from, to }` they resolved to when chosen. `filterRows` therefore never consults
  the clock and the range cannot shift under the user mid-session. `resolveDatePreset`
  takes `today` as an argument so it is testable without freezing time.
- **Blankness is judged before type handling**, so every kind agrees on what empty
  means, and every value-bearing operator excludes blank rows — including negated
  ones, where "not equal to X" on an empty field would otherwise match.
- **Apply is disabled** rather than saving a filter with no value.
- **A bare string is still accepted** as a `contains` text filter, so a value stored
  before filters carried operators keeps working.

**Filtering and editing on the same column was never a real limitation** here. That
was an artifact of the old table putting filters in the header menu _in place of_
other actions; they are independent column attributes in Flow Grid.

**The Studio preview filters for real** (2026-08-26). It gets `filterActions: true`,
its own `_previewFilters`, the same `fgrid_filterEditor`, and its own pill bar.

Filtering is offered in the preview even though editing is not, and the asymmetry is
deliberate: filtering needs no writable data, it is the only way an admin can confirm
from the preview which columns they actually marked filterable, and the preview holds
real sample records so the result is the real behaviour rather than dead chrome. The
search box stays inert because searching a six-row sample demonstrates nothing.

The column descriptors are built the same way as the runtime's — including the
`fieldName` / `configKey` / `path` distinction — so the operators and value controls
an admin sees in the Studio are the ones that appear at runtime.

## 2.7 Search: word mode vs phrase mode

New property `searchEachWord`, added 2026-08-25. Default ON, shown under Search
only when a search bar is enabled.

**Word mode (on).** The term is split on whitespace and every word must appear in
at least one searchable field, in any column and in any order.

**Phrase mode (off).** The whole term must appear within a single column — the
behaviour before this existed.

The reason word mode is the default: a Contact grid showing FirstName and LastName
as separate columns can never find "Chris Smith" in phrase mode, because that
string is in no single field. Word mode finds it, and a single Full Name column
still matches too, since both words are found within that one field.

A single-word search is identical in both modes. Word mode's tradeoff is that words
may match across different columns, so "Chris Smith" also matches a row whose
FirstName is Chris and whose Company is "Smith Ltd" — normal for a search box, and
the filter row still gives per-column precision. That is what the setting is for.

Pinned by tests in `fgrid_gridModel.test.js`: both modes, both name shapes, word
order, blank terms, and that single-word behaviour did not change.

**Note on the property name.** The stored property is `searchWholePhrase`, not
`searchEachWord`, and it defaults false. Word mode has to be the _absence_ of a
stored value, because Flow Builder drops a `false` Boolean and a defaults-on setting
therefore cannot be stored positively — see §4. The editor still shows one positive
checkbox labelled "Search across columns" and inverts it.

---

## 2.6 Incoming data is authoritative — DECIDED 2026-08-25

Agreed rule, wider than the `preSelectedRecords` question that prompted it:

> The record collection feeding the table comes from somewhere upstream. If that
> collection changes, the table updates. **Unsaved changes in the table are
> discarded.** No on-screen warning — the behaviour is documented in the help text
> of the input property.

So on a genuine change to the incoming collection: rebuild the rows, reapply the
preselection over whatever the user had selected, and drop the unsaved inline-edit
overlay (`_editsByKey`). Upstream wins.

**"Genuine" means the content differs, not the array identity.** This is the one
place the implementation must not take the rule literally. Flow reassigns
collection arrays on virtually every re-render, so keying off identity would
discard a user's in-progress edits on unrelated screen activity — which is the
opposite of the intent. Compare a content signature.

Empty vs unset are different: `[]` for `preSelectedRecords` is a deliberate
instruction to deselect everything; `undefined`/`null` means "no opinion, leave
the selection alone", so a flow that ignores the property never disturbs it.

**Bug this also fixes.** `applyPreSelection` currently guards with
`if (this._selectedKeys.length) return` — that asks "is anything selected right
now", not "have I seeded already". A user who deselects everything gets the
preselection silently restored the next time the collection is reassigned. The
signature check replaces that guard.

Sequenced with inline editing, because the overlay being discarded is the thing
inline editing builds.

## 3. Known issues

### 3.1 Combobox option padding

The flow picker's dropdown has a left gutter that `lightning-combobox` reserves
for its selected-check icon, inside its shadow DOM. A styling hook
(`--slds-c-listbox-option-spacing-inline-start`) is set but base components do not
guarantee honouring it. If it still looks indented, the fix is a custom listbox
rather than `lightning-combobox`.

### 3.2 Grid Studio modal — canvas bleed-through — FIXED 2026-09-05

**The cause was never CSS. It was where the modal lived in the DOM.**

Flow Builder wraps the property panel in transformed ancestors. A transform creates
both a containing block for `position: fixed` and a new stacking context, so a
z-index on anything _inside_ the property editor is scoped to that ancestor and
cannot outrank the canvas beside it. The Studio was hand-rolled `slds-modal` markup
rendered in the editor's own subtree, so it was always inside that trap.

Three attempts failed, and all three were aimed at the wrong thing: an explicit
`z-index`, host elevation via the kit's `setPopoverHostActive`, and an opaque
backdrop. The measurement that made this confusing still stands — the Studio
resolved to `z-index: 1000000` and the canvas highlight to `5`, both in the same
stacking context, so the modal _should_ have won outright. It did not, and what bled
was the canvas chip **and** the connector lines.

**What settled it.** A reduced repro reproduced the bleed with **every custom style
removed** — which exonerated the ~190-line stylesheet
completely — and then did **not** bleed once rebuilt on the platform's own SLDS 2
`lightning/modal`, at either `medium` or `large`. A large native modal is wider than
the panel and still did not bleed, which also killed the "it overlaps the canvas
column" theory that had been the documented fallback.

**The fix.** `fgrid_flowGridStudio` extends `LightningModal` and is opened with
`FgridFlowGridStudio.open({ size: "large" })`. The platform renders it in its own
overlay container, outside those transformed ancestors. Deleted along the way: the
`z-index`, the opaque background, the `92vw` width override, the hand-rolled chrome
and its close button, and **both** host elevations (the Studio's and the editor's).

`size="large"` is not a downgrade. SLDS 2 modal sizes are viewport-relative, and
`large` measured at 89% of the viewport against the old 92% — about 90px on a wide
monitor.

**Consequences worth knowing.**

- **Relays are callbacks, not events.** A modal's events do not reach the component
  that opened it, so handlers are passed into `open()`. They are named `notify*`
  rather than `on*`: LWC reserves `on*` property names for event handlers and rejects
  them on `@api`, which is the same rule that makes an `on*` key in `open()` bind an
  event. Invoking passed functions directly also sidesteps the documented requirement
  that modal _events_ need LWS enabled — a real distribution risk otherwise.
- **The Studio hands itself to the editor** through `notifyReady`, because `open()`
  returns a promise rather than an instance and the modal cannot be reached with
  `querySelector`. That handle is what keeps `values` flowing down as the editor
  commits and keeps `collectValidity()` reachable during validation.
- **`sfdx-lwc-jest` 7.9.0 ships no `lightning/modal` stub**, despite the component's
  docs describing shorthand selectors for one. It stubs `modalBody`, `modalFooter` and
  `modalHeader` but not the base class. There is a local stub at
  `flowgrid/test/jest-mocks/lightning/modal.js` and a `moduleNameMapper` entry; delete
  both if a later release adds it. Note the stub keeps its pending resolvers in module
  scope, because LWC bridges only `@api` members between a host element and its
  instance — anything else assigned to the host is invisible to `close()`.
- **LWC freezes component prototypes**, so `close()` cannot be spied. Test it through
  the real contract instead: `open()` mounts it and `this.close()` resolves the
  promise.
- **The nested filter dialog compounds dims.** It carries its own 60% wash, which over
  the platform backdrop and Flow Builder's dim underneath went nearly black by the
  third layer. It now takes a `suppressBackdrop` flag, set only by the Studio. The dim
  stays on by default because the runtime grid opens the same dialog straight onto a
  flow screen. It cannot become a `lightning/modal` itself: that component is
  documented for Lightning Experience and standalone apps, and this one has to work in
  an Experience Cloud site.
- **The platform's modal container carries no transform** — established incidentally,
  since the nested dialog's `position: fixed` still resolves against the viewport
  inside it.

**The repro has been deleted — 2026-09-06.** Its purpose was to prove the platform
modal fixes this, and the Studio has run on it since with no bleed, so it was carrying
no further information. Removed from the org and the repo; recoverable from git history
if the question ever reopens. Deleting the `bleedRepro` bundle also required removing
its component from the smoke-test flow and deleting the three flow versions that still
referenced it — Salesforce refuses to delete a bundle any flow version mentions.

No support ticket was filed. Flow Builder's canvas out-painting a `z-index: 1000000`
element in its own stacking context is still arguably a platform defect, but it stopped
blocking us the moment the Studio moved to `lightning/modal`, and reporting it would
have been a courtesy rather than a need.

## 4. Things that will bite during testing

- **Deploying an LWC while Flow Builder is open produces a phantom "Something went
  wrong".** The open page keeps the module graph it loaded. If a deploy adds a new
  component or changes another's exports, the next re-render that touches them
  fails and Flow Builder's error boundary fires — with the generic "check your
  component configuration for invalid values" message, which points at the wrong
  thing entirely. It survives until a hard refresh, and it is not a defect.
  Observed 2026-08-25 while selecting a multi-select picklist field, right after
  `fgrid_customDatatable` was deployed for the first time. Hard-refresh after every
  deploy before trusting an error.

    **The same cache also hides changes that DID deploy.** Twice on 2026-08-27 a change
    looked unapplied — a relabelled button, then the whole Title Case sweep — and both
    times the org already had it. Before debugging a change that "did not work", confirm
    what is actually deployed:

    ```
    sf data query --use-tooling-api --query "SELECT FilePath, LastModifiedDate FROM \
      LightningComponentResource WHERE LightningComponentBundle.DeveloperName = '<bundle>'"
    ```

    Add `Source` to the SELECT and grep it for the new string. Note that
    `sf project retrieve start --output-dir` silently retrieved NOTHING in this project
    on both attempts, so the Tooling API query is the reliable check.

- **`FlowGrid_Smoke_Test` is no longer in the repo.** Removed 2026-08-27. It was only
  ever a snapshot for version control, never a deployable artifact: it contains the
  ORIGINAL datatable element for side-by-side comparison, whose `official` parameter
  fails validation on the way back in, so it broke any whole-package deploy.

    ```
    official (Screen Component) - The value in "official" is either missing or
    contains multiple fields. Enter a single value.
    ```

    The flow still exists and is maintained IN THE ORG, which is where it is edited and
    where §1.1 and §1.3 expect to find it. Nothing was deleted from the org — only the
    stale file. `flowgrid/force-app` now deploys as a whole.

- **A draft flow cannot be launched.** The row-action picker only lists active
  flows for this reason. `FlowGrid_Edit_Account` is deployed Active.
- **Relationship columns need the Flow to query them.** Flow's "automatically
  store all fields" covers direct fields only, so `Owner.Alias` renders blank
  unless the Get Records element selected it explicitly. Not a grid bug.
- **Autolaunched flows run in system context** by default, ignoring the running
  user's object and field permissions. That is the flow's own configuration, and
  a row action makes it easy to hand a user a button that does more than their
  profile allows.
- **Contract changes are blocked by flows that use the component.** An output
  property cannot be deleted, and an input default cannot be changed, while any
  flow version references the component — including inactive drafts, and versions
  accumulate. `sf project deploy` with a destructive manifest fails on Flow and
  FlowDefinition with "insufficient access rights on cross-reference id"; deleting
  each version by id through the Tooling API works:
  `sf data delete record --use-tooling-api -s Flow -i <versionId>`. Version ids
  come from `SELECT Id, VersionNumber, Definition.DeveloperName FROM Flow`.
  Also note LWC requires every property in `targetConfigs` to have a matching
  `@api`, so the contract and the JS have to change together.
- **Flow Builder does not persist a `false` Boolean input parameter. It drops it.**
  The most expensive thing in this file: four attempts, three wrong diagnoses.
  Verified, not inferred — reading a saved flow's element with
  `SELECT Metadata FROM Flow` via the Tooling API showed only
  `showHeader/showSearchBar/showRecordCount/showSelectedCount/showPagination`, all
  `true`, and **no `false` anywhere in the flow**. Confirmed fixed 2026-08-25.

    The consequence: **a setting that must default ON cannot be stored positively.**
    The editor writes `false`, nothing is stored, and on reopen the absence reads back
    as the default — so the checkbox is uncheckable. No editor-side fix can help;
    removing `default="true"` from the contract does not help either.

    Why it looked like one broken checkbox: every other Boolean defaults **false**, so
    for them "not stored" and "false" render identically. They were equally
    unpersisted, just invisibly. `showBorder` was simply the only defaults-on Boolean
    in the Table Display section.

    **The fix is to store the negative.** `hideBorder`, `hideNameFieldLink`,
    `hideNoneOption` and `searchWholePhrase` replaced their positive counterparts on
    2026-08-25. The editor keeps the positive label and inverts on read and write via
    `invert: true` in `fgrid_propertySchema`, so nothing changed for the admin. This is
    the same reason `hideHeaderActions` and `suppressCurrencyConversion` were already
    framed negatively — the pattern was there, it just was not understood as load-bearing.

    **Rule for any new Boolean: if it should default ON, name it negatively, and give
    it a negative LABEL too.**

    That second half was learned the hard way. Renaming the properties was necessary
    but not sufficient: the first version kept positive labels ("Show a border around
    the grid") and inverted for display with an `invert: true` flag in the schema. It
    did not work, and it re-created the original bug — `dataset.invert` is a string,
    so when the attribute did not render, `inverted` evaluated false and unchecking
    published `false` all over again. The inversion layer was deleted.

    The shape that works is the plainest one, identical to `showRecordCount`:
    `Boolean` with `default="false"` in the contract, `@api hideX = false` at runtime,
    a plain checkbox descriptor, no `DEFAULTS` entry, and a label that states the
    negative. No display translation anywhere. `hideHeaderActions` and
    `suppressCurrencyConversion` had always been this shape, which is why they always
    worked.

    Accepted consequence: a defaults-on setting cannot show a positive label. Current
    labels are "Do not link the Name field", "Hide --None-- in editable picklists" and
    "Limit search to a single column", all confirmed 2026-08-26.

- **The grid draws no border of its own.** `showBorder`/`hideBorder` and its CSS were
  removed entirely on 2026-08-26: the standard datatable does not offer it, and SLDS
  handles the table's own edges. The property left a faint outline visible at the
  grid's corners. Removing it from `targetConfigs` deployed cleanly with the smoke
  test flow in place, because no flow had ever stored the property — no flow version
  deletion was needed.
- **Property defaults cannot be removed once a flow references them.** Salesforce
  refuses to drop a default that an existing flow version uses — an empty string
  counts as removal, and flow versions are immutable. The removals above deployed
  cleanly only because no flow referenced those properties at the time. If this
  bites, delete the blocking flow versions by id through the Tooling API (see
  below).
- **The grid re-reads the actioned row after every flow action.** One query does
  three jobs: a record that has gone means the flow deleted it, a record returned
  when the flow handed nothing back supplies the refresh, and a record returned
  when the flow _did_ hand something back is ignored — the flow's version may be
  an unsaved edit, and the database would overwrite it with stale values. This is
  what lets a flow take only the record Id, do its own DML, and still have the
  table reflect it.
- **Nothing is saved unless a flow does DML.** A screen or autolaunched flow's
  SObject variable is an in-memory value: editing `record.Name` changes the
  variable, not the database. Only a record-triggered before-save flow persists
  `$Record` implicitly. Flow Grid never writes either — it updates its working
  collection and publishes it — so an edit shows in the grid and vanishes on
  reload unless something commits it. Either give the launched flow its own
  Update Records, or add one to the calling flow fed from `outputEditedRecords`
  (only what changed) or `outputRemainingRecords` (the whole working set with
  edits applied). Do not do both, or the record is updated twice.
- **`fToggleChange` is not needed.** The grid owns its collection, so there is no
  reactive round-trip to force and no custom checkbox field required on your
  objects. The one real gap is DML the flow performs without returning the
  record — the grid cannot see database writes. Either have the flow return the
  record, or ask for a refetch-after-flow option.
- **Jest worker segfaults** intermittently on Node 24. `--runInBand` is reliable;
  the kit pins Node >= 22.12 if it becomes noisy.
