/**
 * Grid Studio — a wide two-pane workspace launched from the Flow Builder property
 * panel: every configuration control on the left, a live preview and the column
 * attribute grid on the right.
 *
 * Renders as the platform's own SLDS 2 modal: this extends `LightningModal` and
 * is opened by the editor with `FgridFlowGridStudio.open({ size: "large" })`.
 *
 * WHY THE PLATFORM MODAL, NOT HAND-ROLLED MARKUP
 * Flow Builder wraps the property panel in transformed ancestors. A transform
 * creates both a containing block for `position: fixed` and a new stacking
 * context, so a z-index on any element *inside* the property editor is scoped to
 * that ancestor and cannot outrank the screen canvas beside it. The canvas chip,
 * its Move/Delete buttons and the connector lines painted straight over the old
 * hand-rolled modal, and three separate attempts failed to stop it: an explicit
 * z-index, elevating the component host via the kit's `setPopoverHostActive`, and
 * an opaque backdrop.
 *
 * A reduced repro reproduced the bleed with every custom style removed, which
 * cleared this stylesheet of blame, and showed that the platform modal does not
 * bleed at any size. That repro has been deleted now the fix is confirmed; it is
 * in git history if it is ever needed again. `lightning/modal` renders
 * in the platform's overlay container rather than in the editor's subtree, so it
 * is not a descendant of those transformed ancestors at all. That is the fix: the
 * problem was never CSS, it was where the modal lived in the DOM.
 *
 * `size="large"` is not a downgrade from the old 92vw. SLDS 2 modal sizes are
 * viewport-relative, and `large` measured at 89% of the viewport against the old
 * 92% — a difference of about 90px on a wide monitor.
 *
 * This component owns no configuration state. It renders what the editor hands it
 * and relays every change back up, so the editor stays the single writer to Flow
 * Builder. Preview updates are instant because the editor keeps optimistic local
 * values rather than waiting for Flow Builder to republish inputVariables.
 *
 * RELAYS ARE CALLBACKS, NOT EVENTS
 * A modal's events cannot be caught by the component that opened it — they bubble
 * to a root outside it — so `lightning/modal` requires handlers to be passed into
 * `open()`. Those passed handlers are invoked directly here instead of dispatching
 * events, which also avoids the documented requirement that modal *events* need
 * Lightning Web Security enabled in the org.

     * So this stops trying to observe scrollers and watches the result instead. One
     * probe rect per animation frame; when it moves, tell the kit that something
     * changed and let it recompute from its own anchor. That covers a scroll
