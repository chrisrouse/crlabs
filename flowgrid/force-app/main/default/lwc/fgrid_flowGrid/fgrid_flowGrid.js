/**
 * Flow Grid — runtime screen component.
 *
 * Renders the record collection a Flow supplies, using real field metadata from
 * `FlowGridController.getGridMetadata` and the two JSON configuration properties
 * the property editor writes: `columnFields` (ordered paths) and `columnConfig`
 * (per-column attributes keyed by path).
 *
 * Column derivation is shared with the Grid Studio preview through
 * `c/fgrid_gridModel`, so what an admin previews is what runs.
 *
 * The row pipeline runs in a fixed order, which is what makes the counts read
 * correctly: source -> minus removed -> cap -> search -> filter -> sort -> page.
 * The cap (maxNumberOfRows) sits before search and filter on purpose: it is a
 * ceiling on what the grid will handle, not a ceiling on results.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTED: display, real labels and types, record links, selection and its
 * outputs, sorting, search, per-column filters, pagination, row actions (remove
 * and launch-a-flow), required validation, header and counts, row cap, the
 * user-defined-object JSON source, and inline editing — standard types plus
 * picklist, multi-select picklist and lookup cells via `c/fgrid_customDatatable`.
 *
 * Picklist options can be narrowed two ways, both fed by the same UI API payload:
 * by record type, globally or per row, and by a controlling field for a dependent
 * picklist. See `picklistContext`.

 * side: with the container at 10000, a header at 10000 lost and 10001 won.
 *
 * A high value is defensible HERE in a way it would not be for a popover. A toast
 * is the topmost layer by definition -- SLDS puts it above its own modals -- so
 * being outranked by page chrome is a failure, not politeness. That is the opposite
 * of the vendored kit's `z-index: 1000000` on a picker popover, which paints over
 * Flow Builder chrome that native dropdowns correctly sit within.
 *
 * The write always LANDS. What defeated it for the modal row action is that the
 * platform rewrites the same element's inline style back to 10000 while unmounting
 * `lightning-modal-base`, about 180ms after we set it.
 *
 * Traced with a MutationObserver on `lightning-overlay-container`'s shadow root,
 * following each mutation's `oldValue` for one `lightning-toast-container` -- id
 * stable throughout, so it is rewritten, never replaced:
 *
 *     ms 2459  was 10000    modal opens; we set 100002
 *     ms 2459  was 100002   platform rewrites to 10000
 *     ms 4500  was 10000    our toast() elevation sets 100002
 *     ms 4679  was 100002   platform rewrites to 10000, in the same batch as
 *                           `lightning-modal-base` being REMOVED
 *
 * Nothing rewrites it after teardown, which is what makes a late write stick. See
 * `elevateToastContainer` for why the retry is a window rather than a delay.
 *
 * Do NOT raise the number. It was never too low, and it was never landing on the
