/**
 * Flow Grid — custom property editor.
 *
 * Uses the imperative side of the Flow Config Editor Kit rather than
 * `static flowProperties`, for two reasons the kit's own schema layer states:
 *
 *   1. The declarative schema has no Boolean control. `flowConfigEditorSchema`
 *      recognizes only String, Number, SObject, and field; anything else is
 *      normalized to String. Flow Grid has ~25 booleans.
 *   2. `flowConfigEditorForm` renders one flat list. Flow Grid has ~48 editable
 *      properties, which needs grouping.
 *
 * Everything else still comes from the base class: the four Flow Builder inputs,
 * the input and generic-type-mapping events, `applyCollectionChange()`, and
 * `validate()`. No kit code is forked.
 *
 * Controls are defined once in `c/fgrid_propertySchema` and rendered by
 * `c/fgrid_propertyControls`, in both the narrow panel and the Grid Studio modal.
 * This class is the only writer to Flow Builder.

     * just processed, so a key it had not yet echoed was thrown away too — and

     * The symptom was a value published, wiped a moment later, and re-read as its
     * schema default — most visible on a checkbox defaulting to true, which then
     * could not be unchecked.
     *
     * NOTE: this was NOT the whole story for `showBorder`. That one also declared
     * `default="true"` in the component's meta.xml, which made Flow Builder itself
     * re-assert true; no editor-side change could survive that. The declared

     * whose contract declares a default.
     *
     * A pending entry is therefore retired on PRESENCE, not on matching values: as
     * soon as Flow Builder publishes the property at all, its copy wins, whatever
     * it says. Only keys it has not mentioned are held on to.
     *
     * Presence rather than equality matters in both directions. Equality would make
     * the editor ignore Flow Builder whenever it legitimately reports something
     * different — a value it transformed, or an edit from elsewhere — which is the
     * whole reason the original cleared wholesale.
