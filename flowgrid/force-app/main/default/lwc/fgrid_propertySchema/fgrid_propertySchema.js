/**
 * Single definition of Flow Grid's configuration surface.
 *
 * Both the narrow Flow Builder property panel and the wide Grid Studio modal
 * render from this list, through `c/fgrid_propertyControls`. Defining a control
 * once is what keeps the two surfaces from drifting apart.
 *
 * Every `property` here must exist in fgrid_flowGrid.js-meta.xml. `columnConfig`
 * and `objectApiName` are deliberately absent: the first has its own grid, the
 * second is a mirror the editor maintains, never something an admin edits.
 *
 * LABEL CASE — every `label`, including section labels and option labels, is Title
 * Case. Capitalise each word EXCEPT articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions
 * (and, or, nor, but) and prepositions of three letters or fewer (in, at, on, to, of,
 * by, up, per, via, for, off, as). Longer prepositions are capitalised: "Above",
 * "Without", "Instead". The first word is always capitalised whatever it is.
 *
 *   Show a Header Above the Grid        Records per Page
 *   Load as You Scroll                  Use a User-Defined Object Instead of ...
 *
 * The same applies to `label="..."` in fgrid_flowGrid.js-meta.xml, which is what an
 * admin sees if they ever reach a property outside this editor. Help text and
 * descriptions are ordinary sentences and are NOT title-cased.
